## Section 1: Past Examination Questions

### Question 1 (12 marks) - Source: January 2023, Question 2(b)(ii)

**Context**: Johnny Foster is the project manager for Better Health plc, a pharmaceutical company developing a new pain relief medication. As part of the project planning stage, Johnny needs to gather information from medical professionals about their experiences with existing pain relief medications and their requirements for improved products.

Johnny has decided to conduct **all-day focus groups** with groups of 8-10 doctors and pharmacists. Each focus group session will last approximately 7 hours (9am-4pm) and will involve detailed discussions about medication effectiveness, side effects, and patient feedback. Johnny plans to run four focus group sessions over consecutive weekends.

**Question**: Evaluate Johnny's decision to use all-day focus groups as his primary research method for gathering information from medical professionals.

**Guidance**: In your evaluation, you should consider:
- The benefits and limitations of using focus groups as a research method
- Time and cost implications
- Quality and reliability of data gathered
- Appropriateness for the specific project context
- Alternative approaches that might be more suitable

**Mark allocation**: 
- Level 1 (1-3 marks): Identify features or benefits of focus groups
- Level 2 (4-6 marks): Explain how focus groups work and why they might be chosen
- Level 3 (7-9 marks): Analyse advantages and disadvantages in this specific context
- Level 4 (10-12 marks): Evaluate with justified overall judgement about whether all-day focus groups are appropriate

### Question 2 (6 marks) - Source: June 2024, Question 4(a)

**Context**: Casey Brown is managing a construction project for Hedgerow Tea Ltd to install new automated tea packaging equipment. The project timeline is tight, with only 6 weeks available for supplier selection and equipment procurement. Casey needs information about potential equipment suppliers' reliability, costs, and technical specifications.

Casey is considering using **secondary research** (such as industry reports, supplier websites, trade publications, and existing customer reviews) rather than conducting primary research (such as site visits, supplier interviews, or product testing).

**Question**: Analyse **one advantage** and **one disadvantage** of Casey using secondary research to gather information about potential equipment suppliers.

**Guidance**: 
- For the advantage: Explain clearly why secondary research benefits this project (consider time, cost, accessibility)
- For the disadvantage: Explain clearly what limitations secondary research has (consider specificity, currency, reliability)
- Relate your answers to Casey's specific situation and the construction project context
- Each point should be fully developed with explanation

**Mark allocation**:
- Advantage: 1 mark for identification + up to 2 marks for contextual explanation = 3 marks
- Disadvantage: 1 mark for identification + up to 2 marks for contextual explanation = 3 marks

### Question 4 (8 marks) - Adapted from January 2023, Question 2(b)(ii)

**Context**: Marcus Thompson is the project manager for an automotive manufacturing company planning to introduce robotic assembly systems in their production facility. The project will affect 150 production workers who will need retraining. Marcus needs to gather detailed information about workers' current skills, concerns about automation, and training preferences.

Marcus has decided to use **individual face-to-face interviews** lasting 45-60 minutes with each of the 150 production workers. He plans to conduct 10 interviews per day over a 3-week period, using a semi-structured interview format with open-ended questions.

**Question**: Assess whether individual face-to-face interviews are an appropriate research method for Marcus to gather information from 150 production workers about the planned robotic assembly system implementation.

**Guidance**: In your assessment, you should consider:

## Examination Technique Reminders

1. **Read the question carefully**: Note whether it asks you to "evaluate", "assess", "analyse", "explain", "identify", or "recommend"

2. **Use the context**: Higher marks are awarded for answers that reference the specific project scenario

3. **Structure extended answers**:
   - Introduction: Brief statement of position
   - Analysis: Explore multiple perspectives
   - Evaluation: Weigh evidence and reach justified conclusion
   - Context: Relate to specific project circumstances

4. **Show your reasoning**: Explain WHY something is an advantage or disadvantage, not just WHAT it is

5. **Balance your response**: For "evaluate" or "assess" questions, consider both positive and negative aspects before reaching a conclusion

6. **Manage your time**: Don't spend 15 minutes on a 2-mark question
