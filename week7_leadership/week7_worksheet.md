### Part B: Scenario Application (10 minutes)

For each scenario below, determine:
1. Which leadership style is most appropriate
2. What specific actions the project manager should take
3. What risks arise from using inappropriate leadership styles

---

#### Scenario 1: Crisis Management

Your engineering project is commissioning a new control system when a critical safety sensor fails. The facility must shut down immediately. Your team includes two experienced engineers, three graduate trainees, and two contractors. You have 48 hours to diagnose and resolve the issue before contractual penalties apply. The client is extremely anxious.

**Most appropriate leadership style:**

**Specific actions to take:**

**Risks of inappropriate leadership:**

---

#### Scenario 2: Innovation Challenge

Your team is tasked with developing an innovative solution to reduce energy consumption in a manufacturing process by 30%. The target seems ambitious, but your team of experienced engineers has diverse expertise in mechanical, electrical, and process engineering. You have six weeks to develop and present a proposal.

**Most appropriate leadership style:**

**Specific actions to take:**

**Risks of inappropriate leadership:**

---

#### Scenario 3: Team Conflict

Two senior engineers on your project have developed a significant disagreement about the appropriate technical approach for a design challenge. Both are technically competent, but tensions are affecting team morale. Other team members are taking sides. The disagreement is delaying critical design decisions.

**Most appropriate leadership style:**

**Specific actions to take:**

**Risks of inappropriate leadership:**

---

### Reflection Questions

1. How did you feel about the leadership style you would naturally use versus what the situation demanded?

2. What makes it difficult to adopt a leadership style that doesn't come naturally?

3. Can you think of situations in your own experience where inappropriate leadership styles caused problems?

---

## Activity 2: Communication Channel Selection Exercise

For each scenario below, identify:
1. The most appropriate communication channel(s)
2. Justification for your selection
3. What could go wrong if an inappropriate channel were used

---

### Scenario A: Schedule Change Notification

You need to inform 45 project team members about a change to next week's project schedule due to delayed equipment delivery. The change affects different people in different ways—some will need to reschedule activities, others are unaffected. You need to ensure everyone receives the information and understands what they need to do.

**Most appropriate communication channel(s):**

**Justification:**

**Potential problems with inappropriate channel:**

---

### Scenario B: Quality Concerns

The client has expressed significant concerns about quality standards following a recent site inspection. Their concerns are partially based on misunderstanding of the construction sequence, but there are also some legitimate issues that need addressing. This is a sensitive situation that could affect the client relationship and project reputation.

**Most appropriate communication channel(s):**

**Justification:**

**Potential problems with inappropriate channel:**

---

### Scenario C: Steering Committee Report

You need to provide a monthly progress report to the project steering committee. The report should cover schedule performance, budget variance, key risks, and any decisions required. The steering committee includes the project sponsor, finance director, and operations director.

**Most appropriate communication channel(s):**

**Justification:**

**Potential problems with inappropriate channel:**

---

### Scenario D: Personal Work-Life Balance Concern

A team member has requested a meeting to discuss personal concerns about work-life balance. They are working excessive hours and are showing signs of stress.

**Most appropriate communication channel(s):**

**Justification:**

**Potential problems with inappropriate channel:**

---

### Scenario E: Routine Progress Update

You need to communicate routine weekly progress information to the project team. This includes tasks completed, tasks in progress, any blockers identified, and priorities for the coming week. This is regular, factual information that the team is accustomed to receiving.

**Most appropriate communication channel(s):**

**Justification:**

**Potential problems with inappropriate channel:**

---

## Activity 3: Negotiation Role-Play

### Scenario Brief

**Setup:** Two people will role-play this negotiation scenario while others observe using the checklist below.

---

#### Role: Project Manager

Your engineering project is entering a critical phase requiring specialist electrical engineering expertise for six weeks. You have requested two senior electrical engineers from the functional department. The functional manager has told you only one engineer is available. You need two engineers to maintain the project schedule—delays will trigger penalty clauses. Your position is weak because you cannot go to another source for these skills.

**Your objectives:**
- Secure adequate electrical engineering resources
- Maintain project schedule
- Preserve relationship with functional manager

**Consider:**
- What are your underlying interests (not just positions)?
- What creative options might satisfy both parties?
- What objective criteria could help resolve this?

---

#### Role: Functional Manager

You manage a team of electrical engineers who support multiple projects. The project manager has requested two senior engineers for six weeks. You have three senior engineers, but one is on annual leave and another is needed for business-as-usual operations. You could potentially provide one senior engineer plus one junior engineer, but the project manager specifically requested senior resources. You want to support the project but cannot leave your department unable to function.

**Your objectives:**
- Support the project where possible
- Maintain departmental operations
- Develop junior staff capabilities

**Consider:**
- What are your underlying interests (not just positions)?
- What creative options might satisfy both parties?
- What objective criteria could help resolve this?

---

### Observer Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate the negotiation:

**Principled Negotiation Techniques:**

| Technique | Observed? (Y/N) | Examples/Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Separated people from problem | | |
| Focused on interests rather than positions | | |
| Generated options for mutual gain | | |
| Used objective criteria | | |
| Listened actively | | |
| Acknowledged other party's concerns | | |
| Proposed creative solutions | | |
| Maintained professional tone | | |

**Outcome:**
- □ Win-Win (both parties satisfied)
- □ Win-Lose (one party gains at other's expense)
- □ No Agreement (deadlock)
- □ Other: _________________

**What worked well:**

**What could be improved:**

**Possible solutions that satisfy both parties' interests:**
