## Introduction
**(Time: 5 minutes | LO2.2)**

Effective project management extends far beyond technical competence and planning skills. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI, 2017), approximately 75% of project success depends on effective communication and leadership, whilst only 25% relates to technical aspects. This statistic underscores a critical reality in engineering project management: technical excellence alone does not guarantee project success.

Consider the case of the Denver International Airport baggage handling system project in the 1990s. This engineering project, which overran by 16 months and cost $560 million, failed primarily due to poor communication between stakeholders and ineffective leadership in managing competing interests (Montealegre and Keil, 2000). The technical solution was sound, but the project management approach was fundamentally flawed.

In this workshop, learners will explore the essential 'soft skills' that distinguish competent project managers from exceptional ones. These skills—leadership, communication, and negotiation—form the cornerstone of effective stakeholder management and team performance. Through theoretical understanding and practical application, learners will develop the capability to adapt their leadership approach, communicate strategically, and negotiate effectively to drive project success.

The engineering profession has evolved considerably over recent decades. Modern engineering projects typically involve multidisciplinary teams, diverse stakeholder groups, and complex organisational structures. Engineers who can combine their technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills are highly valued by employers (Royal Academy of Engineering, 2019). This session addresses that critical skill gap.

## Section 1: Leadership Styles in Project Management
**(Time: 20 minutes | LO2.2)**

### 1.1 Understanding Leadership in the Project Context

Leadership in project management differs fundamentally from general management leadership. Whilst managers in permanent organisational structures can rely on positional authority and established procedures, project managers must influence without direct authority (Müller and Turner, 2010). Project team members often have reporting lines to functional managers, not the project manager, creating a matrix structure that demands sophisticated leadership approaches.

Effective project leadership involves:
- **Vision articulation**: Clearly communicating project objectives and their strategic importance
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Ensuring all parties understand their roles and responsibilities
- **Team motivation**: Inspiring commitment despite competing priorities
- **Adaptive decision-making**: Adjusting approaches based on project phases and circumstances

The Association for Project Management (APM, 2019) emphasises that project managers must develop situational awareness—the ability to read project contexts and adapt their leadership style accordingly.

### 1.2 The Three Primary Leadership Styles

Research by Hersey and Blanchard (1969) identified that effective leaders adapt their style based on the maturity and competence of their team members. For project management contexts, three primary styles emerge as particularly relevant:

#### 1.2.1 Directive Leadership

**Definition and characteristics:**

Directive leadership, also termed 'authoritative' or 'command' leadership, involves the project manager providing clear instructions, establishing tight controls, and making decisions with limited team input (Goleman, 2000). This style is characterised by:

- Clear specification of tasks and deadlines
- Centralised decision-making authority
- Frequent monitoring and oversight
- Explicit performance standards
- Limited delegation of responsibility

**Appropriate applications:**

Directive leadership proves most effective in specific project contexts:

1. **Crisis situations**: When rapid decisions are essential, such as during critical project failures or safety incidents
2. **High-risk activities**: When errors could have severe consequences, such as commissioning safety-critical systems
3. **Inexperienced teams**: When team members lack the knowledge or confidence to work independently
4. **Tight deadlines**: When schedule pressure demands focused, coordinated action
5. **Regulatory compliance**: When strict adherence to procedures is mandatory

**Benefits:**
- Provides clarity and reduces ambiguity
- Enables rapid decision-making
- Ensures consistency in approach
- Reduces risk of errors through close supervision

**Limitations:**
- Can demotivate experienced team members
- Stifles creativity and innovation
- Creates dependency on the project manager
- May lead to team disengagement over extended periods

**Engineering example:**

During the commissioning phase of a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant, a project manager employed directive leadership to ensure precise adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) protocols. Each validation step required explicit authorisation, with comprehensive checklists and mandatory sign-offs. This approach was essential given regulatory requirements and the severe consequences of non-compliance (Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, 2018).

#### 1.2.2 Supportive Leadership

**Definition and characteristics:**

Supportive leadership, sometimes called 'coaching' or 'affiliative' leadership, focuses on team members' development, wellbeing, and morale (Goleman, 2000). Key characteristics include:

- Emphasis on relationships and team cohesion
- Active listening and empathy
- Focus on personal development
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Recognition and positive reinforcement

**Appropriate applications:**

Supportive leadership works particularly well when:

1. **Building team cohesion**: During project formation or when integrating new members
2. **Managing stress**: When team members face challenging personal or professional circumstances
3. **Developing capabilities**: When investing in team learning and skill development
4. **Recovering from setbacks**: When morale requires boosting after project difficulties
5. **Encouraging innovation**: When creative solutions require psychological safety

**Benefits:**
- Builds strong team relationships and trust
- Increases team member satisfaction and engagement
- Encourages knowledge sharing and collaboration
- Develops team capabilities for future projects

**Limitations:**
- May lead to insufficient performance management
- Can result in missed deadlines if overused
- Risk of avoiding difficult conversations
- May create perception of favouritism

**Engineering example:**

Following a failed design review that significantly delayed a product development project, the project manager adopted a supportive leadership approach. Rather than apportioning blame, she conducted individual discussions with each team member to understand their concerns, provided additional resources for technical development, and facilitated peer learning sessions. This approach restored team confidence and improved subsequent design iterations (Engineering Council UK, 2020).

#### 1.2.3 Collaborative Leadership

**Definition and characteristics:**

Collaborative leadership, also termed 'democratic' or 'participative' leadership, involves shared decision-making and collective problem-solving (Bass and Riggio, 2006). Characteristics include:

- Consensus-building approaches
- Team involvement in planning and decision-making
- Shared responsibility for outcomes
- Emphasis on diverse perspectives
- Facilitation rather than direction

**Appropriate applications:**

Collaborative leadership is most effective when:

1. **Complex problems**: When challenges require diverse expertise and perspectives
2. **Innovation projects**: When creative solutions demand collective intelligence
3. **Experienced teams**: When team members possess high competence and commitment
4. **Change management**: When securing buy-in for new approaches or technologies
5. **Cross-functional projects**: When integrating different engineering disciplines

**Benefits:**
- Leverages diverse knowledge and experience
- Increases team ownership and commitment
- Improves decision quality through multiple perspectives
- Develops team members' decision-making capabilities

**Limitations:**
- Time-consuming decision-making process
- Risk of 'analysis paralysis' in urgent situations
- Potential for conflict if consensus cannot be reached
- May frustrate team members seeking clear direction

**Engineering example:**

During the design phase of a sustainable energy installation project, the project manager convened regular design workshops bringing together electrical engineers, structural engineers, environmental specialists, and commercial advisors. These collaborative sessions enabled the team to identify innovative solutions that balanced technical performance, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness—outcomes that would have been unlikely through directive leadership (Institution of Civil Engineers, 2019).

### 1.3 Situational Leadership: Adapting Styles to Context

Effective project managers do not rely on a single leadership style but rather develop the capability to adapt their approach based on situational factors (Hersey and Blanchard, 1969). Key considerations include:

**Project phase:**
- **Initiation**: Often requires directive leadership to establish structures
- **Planning**: Benefits from collaborative approaches to secure buy-in
- **Execution**: May alternate between directive (for critical path activities) and supportive (for team morale)
- **Closure**: Supportive leadership helps consolidate learning and maintain relationships

**Team maturity:**
- **Forming**: Requires directive leadership to establish norms
- **Storming**: Benefits from supportive leadership to navigate conflicts
- **Norming**: Enables collaborative approaches as trust develops
- **Performing**: Minimal intervention allows team self-management

**Task characteristics:**
- **Routine tasks**: Directive approaches ensure consistency
- **Complex problems**: Collaborative approaches leverage expertise
- **Sensitive situations**: Supportive approaches maintain relationships

## Section 2: Communication Strategies
**(Time: 20 minutes | LO2.2)**

### 2.1 The Critical Role of Communication in Project Success

Research consistently identifies communication as the most significant factor determining project success or failure. A study by the Project Management Institute (PMI, 2018) found that ineffective communication was the primary contributor to project failure one-third of the time, whilst only 55% of project managers believed their organisations valued communication skills.

In engineering projects, communication challenges are particularly acute due to:
- **Technical complexity**: Difficulty translating technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders
- **Multidisciplinary teams**: Different professional languages and perspectives
- **Distributed teams**: Geographic and temporal separation
- **Diverse stakeholders**: Varying information needs and preferences

The Standish Group's CHAOS Report (2015) demonstrated that projects with highly effective communication were 50% more likely to complete successfully compared to those with poor communication practices.

### 2.2 Internal and External Communication

#### 2.2.1 Internal Communication

Internal communication occurs within the project team and immediate organisational context. Effective internal communication serves multiple functions:

**Purpose:**
- Coordinating activities and dependencies
- Sharing technical information and decisions
- Building team cohesion and morale
- Identifying and resolving issues
- Tracking progress and performance

**Characteristics of effective internal communication:**

1. **Frequency**: Regular, predictable communication rhythms (e.g., daily stand-ups, weekly team meetings)
2. **Transparency**: Open sharing of information, including challenges and setbacks
3. **Two-way dialogue**: Opportunities for team members to contribute and question
4. **Accessibility**: Multiple channels ensuring all team members can participate
5. **Documentation**: Records of decisions and rationale for future reference

**Methods and tools:**
- Team meetings and briefings
- Project management software (e.g., Microsoft Project, Asana, Trello)
- Collaboration platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack)
- Shared document repositories (e.g., SharePoint, Google Workspace)
- Progress reports and dashboards

**Engineering example:**

A construction engineering project implemented a 'three-tier' communication structure: daily toolbox talks for site teams, weekly coordination meetings for section leaders, and fortnightly steering committee meetings for senior management. This structured approach ensured information flowed appropriately without overwhelming any single group (Construction Industry Council, 2020).

#### 2.2.2 External Communication

External communication involves stakeholders outside the immediate project team, including:
- Project sponsors and senior management
- Clients and end users
- Suppliers and contractors
- Regulatory authorities
- Community groups and the public

**Purpose:**
- Managing expectations and securing continued support
- Reporting progress and demonstrating value
- Obtaining approvals and resources
- Managing risks and issues
- Building stakeholder confidence

**Characteristics of effective external communication:**

1. **Audience-appropriate**: Tailored to stakeholder knowledge and interests
2. **Professional**: Maintaining organisational reputation and credibility
3. **Strategic timing**: Aligned with decision-making and review cycles
4. **Emphasis on outcomes**: Focusing on benefits and achievements rather than technical details
5. **Proactive**: Anticipating concerns and addressing them before they escalate

**Methods and tools:**
- Formal reports and presentations
- Steering committee meetings
- Stakeholder briefings and workshops
- Email updates and newsletters
- Public consultations and exhibitions

### 2.3 Selecting Appropriate Communication Channels

The richness and formality of communication channels vary considerably. Daft and Lengel's (1986) Media Richness Theory provides a framework for matching communication channels to message characteristics:

#### 2.3.1 Channel Characteristics

**High-richness channels** (face-to-face, video calls):
- **Advantages**: Enable immediate feedback, non-verbal cues, relationship building
- **Appropriate for**: Complex issues, sensitive topics, initial stakeholder engagement
- **Disadvantages**: Time-consuming, difficult to schedule, limited documentation

**Medium-richness channels** (telephone calls, video messages):
- **Advantages**: Provide verbal tone and some interaction
- **Appropriate for**: Clarifications, routine updates, relationship maintenance
- **Disadvantages**: No permanent record unless recorded, scheduling challenges

**Low-richness channels** (email, written reports, dashboards):
- **Advantages**: Permanent record, time-efficient, can reach many people
- **Appropriate for**: Routine information, factual updates, formal documentation
- **Disadvantages**: Risk of misinterpretation, delayed feedback, impersonal

#### 2.3.2 Decision Framework for Channel Selection

When determining the appropriate communication channel, project managers should consider:

1. **Message complexity**: More complex messages require richer channels
2. **Urgency**: Time-critical communications may require immediate channels (phone, face-to-face)
3. **Audience size**: Large audiences may necessitate written or broadcast methods
4. **Formality requirements**: Official approvals require documented channels
5. **Relationship quality**: Weaker relationships benefit from richer channels
6. **Cultural considerations**: Cultural norms influence channel appropriateness

**Engineering example:**

When a design fault was discovered in a bridge project that required significant rework, the project manager convened an immediate face-to-face meeting with the client and design team to discuss implications and solutions. Following this, a formal written report documented the issue, proposed solutions, and revised schedule. This combination of rich initial communication (to build understanding and trust) followed by formal documentation (for record-keeping and approval) exemplified appropriate channel selection (Institution of Structural Engineers, 2021).

### 2.4 Communication Planning

The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBoK) identifies communication planning as a critical component of project management (PMI, 2017). An effective communications management plan should specify:

1. **Stakeholder communication requirements**: What each stakeholder group needs to know, when, and in what format
2. **Frequency and timing**: Regular communication schedules aligned with project milestones
3. **Responsibilities**: Who is responsible for producing and distributing each communication
4. **Escalation protocols**: How and when issues are escalated to higher authority
5. **Feedback mechanisms**: How stakeholders can raise questions or concerns

**Template communication matrix:**

```
+----------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+
| Stakeholder    | Information Need | Frequency    | Channel    | Responsible   |
+----------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+
| Project Sponsor| Overall status   | Monthly      | Report +   | Project       |
|                | Budget variance  |              | Meeting    | Manager       |
+----------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+
| Project Team   | Task assignments | Daily        | Team       | Team Leaders  |
|                | Issue resolution | As required  | Software   |               |
+----------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+
| Client         | Milestone        | Fortnightly  | Formal     | Project       |
|                | progress         |              | Report     | Manager       |
+----------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+
| End Users      | Implementation   | Monthly      | Newsletter | Communications|
|                | updates          |              |            | Lead          |
+----------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+

## Section 3: Negotiation Techniques
**(Time: 10 minutes | LO2.2)**

### 3.1 The Necessity of Negotiation in Project Management

Project managers negotiate constantly—for resources, priorities, deadlines, quality standards, and budget allocations. Unlike commercial negotiation focused primarily on price, project negotiation encompasses multiple dimensions and involves parties with ongoing relationships (Fisher and Ury, 1991).

Situations requiring negotiation include:
- Securing budget approvals from project sponsors
- Obtaining resources from functional managers
- Agreeing scope changes with clients
- Resolving conflicts between team members
- Negotiating contracts with suppliers
- Managing competing priorities among stakeholders

### 3.2 Principled Negotiation: The Harvard Model

Fisher and Ury's (1991) seminal work "Getting to Yes" established principled negotiation as the foundation of modern negotiation practice. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional positional bargaining:

**Positional bargaining** (ineffective approach):
- Parties take opposing positions and defend them
- Success measured by concessions extracted
- Relationship damage is acceptable to achieve outcome
- Results in win-lose outcomes

**Principled negotiation** (effective approach):
- Focus on interests rather than positions
- Generate options for mutual gain
- Use objective criteria for decisions
- Separate people from the problem

### 3.3 The Four Principles of Effective Negotiation

#### 3.3.1 Separate People from the Problem

**Concept:**
Negotiations involve both substantive issues (what is being negotiated) and relationship issues (how parties interact). Effective negotiators address both dimensions separately, maintaining positive working relationships whilst dealing firmly with the substantive problem (Fisher and Ury, 1991).

**Techniques:**
- Focus criticism on the issue, not the individual
- Acknowledge emotions without letting them control the discussion
- Build working relationships independent of agreement on substance
- Use 'we' language to frame problems as shared challenges

**Engineering example:**
When a supplier consistently delivered materials late, threatening the project schedule, the project manager framed the discussion as "We have a shared challenge in meeting our client's deadline. How can we work together to improve delivery reliability?" rather than "Your late deliveries are jeopardising my project." This approach maintained the relationship whilst addressing the substantive issue (Chartered Institute of Building, 2019).

#### 3.3.2 Focus on Interests, Not Positions

**Concept:**
Positions are what people say they want; interests are why they want it. Behind opposed positions often lie shared or compatible interests. By exploring underlying interests, negotiators can identify creative solutions that satisfy both parties (Fisher and Ury, 1991).

**Techniques:**
- Ask "Why?" and "Why not?" to understand underlying concerns
- Identify multiple interests (not just one dominant issue)
- Acknowledge the other party's interests as legitimate
- Look for shared interests to build common ground

**Engineering example:**
A client initially insisted on a two-week reduction in project schedule (their position). Through questioning, the project manager discovered their underlying interest was ensuring the facility was operational for a major client visit. By understanding this interest, the project team proposed completing just the showcase area fully, whilst work continued elsewhere—satisfying the client's actual need without the impossible schedule compression (Association for Project Management, 2020).

#### 3.3.3 Generate Options for Mutual Gain

**Concept:**
Rather than assuming a fixed pie that must be divided, effective negotiators expand the pie by creating options that benefit all parties. Brainstorming solutions before evaluating them prevents premature judgement and encourages creativity (Fisher and Uy, 1991).

**Techniques:**
- Separate inventing from deciding—generate many options before evaluating
- Look for trades that have different value to each party
- Make the decision easy for the other party
- Consider what-if scenarios and contingent agreements

**Engineering example:**
When negotiating resource allocation with a functional manager who was reluctant to release senior engineers, the project manager offered to accept junior engineers supplemented with specific training, whilst agreeing to return the functional manager's staff earlier than originally planned. This trade gave the functional manager confidence in junior staff development and gave the project access to necessary skills (Royal Academy of Engineering, 2019).

#### 3.3.4 Use Objective Criteria

**Concept:**
Rather than a contest of wills, negotiations should be based on fair standards independent of either side's desires. Objective criteria could include market value, industry standards, legal precedent, or technical specifications (Fisher and Ury, 1991).

**Techniques:**
- Frame issues as a joint search for fair standards
- Be open to reason about which standards apply
- Never yield to pressure, only to principle
- Use multiple standards to test fairness

**Engineering example:**
When a client requested changes to specifications that would increase costs, the project manager referenced industry standard pricing guides and previous similar projects to establish fair rates for the variation. This objective approach prevented a protracted dispute about whether the charges were reasonable (Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 2020).

### 3.4 Dealing with Difficult Negotiations

Not all negotiations proceed smoothly. Project managers must be prepared to handle:

**Tactics to counter:**
- **Anchoring**: Extreme opening positions designed to shift the negotiation range
  - *Counter*: Refocus on objective criteria and ignore the anchor
- **Good cop/bad cop**: Team members taking opposing stances
  - *Counter*: Acknowledge the tactic and request consistency
- **Limited authority**: Claims of inability to make decisions
  - *Counter*: Clarify authority levels before detailed negotiation
- **Time pressure**: Artificial deadlines to force concessions
  - *Counter*: Identify your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)

**Your BATNA:**
Fisher and Uy (1991) emphasise the importance of knowing your BATNA—what you will do if negotiation fails. A strong BATNA provides negotiating power and prevents accepting unfavourable agreements.

## Conclusion
**(Time: 10 minutes | LO2.2)**

This workshop has explored three essential competencies for effective project management: leadership, communication, and negotiation. These skills represent the 'softer' side of project management that often determines project success or failure.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Adaptive leadership is essential**: No single leadership style suits all situations. Effective project managers develop the situational awareness to recognise when directive, supportive, or collaborative approaches are most appropriate. The ability to flex between styles based on team maturity, project phase, and task characteristics distinguishes exceptional project managers.

2. **Strategic communication drives alignment**: Communication is not merely information transfer but a strategic activity that builds understanding, secures commitment, and manages expectations. Selecting appropriate communication channels, planning communication systematically, and adapting messages to different audiences are core project management competencies.

3. **Principled negotiation preserves relationships**: Project managers negotiate constantly, often with parties they must continue working with throughout the project lifecycle. Principled negotiation—focusing on interests rather than positions, generating options for mutual gain, and using objective criteria—enables project managers to secure necessary resources and agreements whilst maintaining positive relationships.

4. **Integration of skills**: These three competencies do not operate in isolation. Effective leadership requires clear communication; successful negotiation depends on understanding stakeholder interests (a communication skill); and collaborative leadership inherently involves negotiation. Project managers must develop an integrated skillset that draws on all three areas.

5. **Consequences of deficiency**: Projects with poor leadership become directionless or demotivated; projects with ineffective communication suffer from misalignment and conflict; projects with inadequate negotiation fail to secure essential resources. Developing these skills is not optional for project managers—it is fundamental to project success.

The engineering profession increasingly recognises that technical excellence must be complemented by strong interpersonal skills. As the Royal Academy of Engineering (2019) notes, "the engineers of tomorrow will need to combine deep technical knowledge with the ability to lead teams, communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders, and navigate complex organisational dynamics."

Learners are encouraged to consciously practice these skills in their academic projects, work placements, and early career roles. Leadership, communication, and negotiation are capabilities that develop through deliberate practice and reflection, not merely theoretical understanding.

## Case Study: The Thames Tideway Tunnel Project

### Background

The Thames Tideway Tunnel, also known as London's "super sewer," is one of Europe's largest infrastructure projects. The 25-kilometre tunnel, being constructed at a depth of up to 65 metres beneath the River Thames, will intercept sewage overflows that currently discharge into the river during heavy rainfall (Thames Tideway, 2021).

### Leadership Challenges and Approaches

The project faced significant leadership challenges:

**Challenge 1: Multi-stakeholder coordination**
The project involved over 20 main contractors, five major joint ventures, numerous subcontractors, plus multiple regulatory authorities, local councils, and community groups. The project leadership team had to coordinate activities across this complex stakeholder landscape.

**Leadership response:**
The project adopted a **collaborative leadership** approach for strategic decisions whilst maintaining **directive leadership** for safety-critical activities. Monthly stakeholder forums brought together representatives from all contractor groups to share learning and coordinate activities. However, safety protocols were non-negotiable, with clear directive leadership ensuring compliance (Thames Tideway, 2021).

**Challenge 2: Community relations**
The project required 24-hour construction in residential areas, creating noise, traffic disruption, and community concern. Local residents were initially hostile to the project.

**Leadership response:**
The project team adopted a **supportive leadership** style with community stakeholders. They established community liaison teams who lived locally, held monthly community meetings to hear concerns, and implemented community investment programmes. This approach transformed relationships from hostility to constructive engagement (Construction News, 2020).

### Communication Strategies

**Challenge: Communicating technical complexity**
Explaining the necessity and technical approach of the super sewer to diverse audiences—from regulatory engineers to local residents to political stakeholders—required sophisticated communication strategies.

**Communication response:**
- **For technical audiences**: Detailed engineering reports, technical presentations, and peer-reviewed publications
- **For community stakeholders**: Visual exhibitions, animated videos, site tours, and plain-English newsletters
- **For political stakeholders**: Executive briefings emphasising benefits, progress milestones, and economic impact
- **For media**: Media packs, press conferences, and social media engagement

The project developed a comprehensive communications management plan that specified communication requirements for 15 different stakeholder groups, with different channels, frequencies, and content for each group (Thames Tideway, 2021).

### Negotiation Examples

**Challenge: Right-of-access negotiations**
The project required access to over 5,000 properties for site investigations, construction access, and connection works. Many property owners were reluctant to grant access.

**Negotiation approach:**
Rather than relying solely on compulsory purchase powers, the project team adopted principled negotiation:
- **Interests focus**: Understood property owners' concerns about disruption, property value, and compensation
- **Objective criteria**: Used independent valuations and industry-standard compensation rates
- **Mutual gain options**: Offered improvements to private infrastructure (e.g., upgraded sewage connections) alongside access agreements
- **People/problem separation**: Community liaison teams built relationships separate from legal negotiations

This approach achieved voluntary agreements with over 90% of property owners, reducing legal costs and maintaining community goodwill (Institution of Civil Engineers, 2021).

### Outcomes and Learning

The Thames Tideway Tunnel project demonstrates the critical importance of leadership, communication, and negotiation in managing complex engineering projects:

1. **Adaptive leadership**: The project successfully combined directive leadership (for safety), collaborative leadership (for coordination), and supportive leadership (for community relations)

2. **Strategic communication**: Tailored communication approaches for different stakeholder groups prevented misunderstanding and maintained support

3. **Principled negotiation**: Focus on interests and mutual gain achieved agreements whilst preserving relationships

**Key lessons:**
- Leadership style must adapt to stakeholder groups and project phases
- Communication planning should explicitly address each stakeholder group's needs
- Investment in negotiation relationships yields long-term benefits
- Integration of leadership, communication, and negotiation skills is essential for complex project success
