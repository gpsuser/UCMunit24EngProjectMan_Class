## Introduction (3 minutes)

**LO2.2**

Welcome to Week 8, where the focus shifts to the essential skills that distinguish competent project managers from exceptional ones. In previous sessions, learners explored leadership styles and communication strategies. Today's lecture concentrates on five fundamental skill areas that form the operational backbone of effective project management: planning, time management, decision-making, delegation, and information management.

According to the Project Management Institute (2021), approximately 70% of projects fail due to poor planning and inadequate management skills rather than technical deficiencies. This statistic underscores the critical importance of mastering these core competencies. Engineering projects, whether designing a new automotive component or implementing a manufacturing process improvement, require project managers who can plan systematically, manage time efficiently, make sound decisions, delegate appropriately, and handle information effectively.

The skills covered in this lecture are not isolated competencies but interconnected capabilities that, when combined, enable project managers to navigate the complexities of engineering projects successfully.

## 1. Planning Skills in Project Management (10 minutes)

**LO2.2 (Planning)**

### 1.1 The Nature of Planning

Planning represents the foundational skill for project managers. It involves determining what needs to be accomplished, identifying who will perform each task, and establishing when activities should occur. Effective planning transforms abstract project objectives into concrete, actionable steps (Lock, 2020).

Planning in project management comprises three essential elements:

- **Scheduling**: Creating a timeline of activities and determining their sequence
- **Resource allocation**: Assigning personnel, equipment, and materials to specific tasks
- **Contingency preparation**: Building flexibility into plans to accommodate uncertainties

### 1.2 Key Planning Activities

#### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The Work Breakdown Structure decomposes complex projects into manageable components. For example, in designing a new hydraulic system for agricultural machinery, the WBS might include subsystems such as pump selection, valve configuration, hydraulic fluid specification, and testing protocols. Each component can be further subdivided until reaching a level where tasks can be assigned to individuals (Kerzner, 2017).

#### Scheduling Techniques

Project managers must schedule activities by:

- Identifying dependencies between tasks
- Estimating duration for each activity
- Establishing milestones and checkpoints
- Creating buffer time for critical activities

The planning process requires continuous refinement. Initial plans serve as starting points, but effective project managers regularly review and adjust schedules based on actual progress and emerging challenges.

### 1.3 Benefits and Limitations of Planning

**Benefits:**
- Provides clear direction and reduces ambiguity
- Enables early identification of resource requirements
- Facilitates communication among stakeholders
- Creates baseline for measuring progress (Project Management Institute, 2017)

**Limitations:**
- Time-consuming initial investment
- Risk of over-planning, leading to inflexibility
- Plans can become outdated quickly in dynamic environments
- May create false sense of certainty

### 1.4 Consequences of Poor Planning

Projects suffering from inadequate planning commonly experience:

- Scope creep (uncontrolled expansion of project requirements)
- Resource conflicts and shortages
- Missed deadlines and budget overruns
- Stakeholder dissatisfaction
- Team confusion and low morale

**Example Case Study**: The initial design phase of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner experienced significant delays partly due to inadequate planning of the supply chain integration. The complexity of coordinating 50 suppliers across multiple countries was underestimated, resulting in production delays exceeding two years and substantial cost overruns (Tang and Zimmerman, 2009).

### 1.5 Improving Planning Effectiveness

Recommendations for strengthening planning skills include:

1. Involve team members in planning processes to leverage diverse expertise
2. Use historical data from previous projects to improve estimation accuracy
3. Build iterative review cycles into planning procedures
4. Balance detail with flexibility
5. Document assumptions explicitly

---

## 2. Time Management Techniques (12 minutes)

**LO2.2 (Time management)**

### 2.1 The Critical Nature of Time Management

Time represents an irreplaceable project resource. Unlike budget or personnel, which can sometimes be adjusted, time, once elapsed, cannot be recovered. Effective time management distinguishes successful project managers from those who consistently struggle with delays (Verzuh, 2015).

Time management in project contexts encompasses:

- **Task duration estimation**: Determining realistic timeframes for activities
- **Progress tracking**: Monitoring actual versus planned completion
- **Deadline management**: Ensuring milestones are achieved on schedule
- **Schedule adjustment**: Responding to delays proactively

### 2.2 Task Duration Estimation

Accurate estimation forms the foundation of time management. Several factors influence duration estimates:

**Complexity factors:**
- Technical difficulty
- Required expertise level
- Dependencies on other activities
- Availability of resources

**Environmental factors:**
- Organisational procedures
- Regulatory requirements
- External dependencies
- Seasonal variations

Project managers should employ multiple estimation techniques:

**Three-point estimation:**
```
Expected Duration = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6
```

**Analogous estimation:** Using historical data from similar tasks

**Parametric estimation:** Applying statistical relationships between variables

### 2.3 Time Management Tools

#### Priority Matrices

The Eisenhower Matrix categorises tasks by urgency and importance:

```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│  URGENT & IMPORTANT │ NOT URGENT BUT      │
│                     │ IMPORTANT           │
│  Do First           │ Schedule            │
│  (Crisis management)│ (Planning,          │
│                     │  prevention)        │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│  URGENT BUT NOT     │ NOT URGENT &        │
│  IMPORTANT          │ NOT IMPORTANT       │
│                     │                     │
│  Delegate           │ Eliminate           │
│  (Interruptions)    │ (Time wasters)      │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

This framework helps project managers allocate attention appropriately. Critical path activities typically fall into the "Urgent & Important" quadrant, whilst risk mitigation activities belong in "Not Urgent but Important" (Covey, 2004).

#### Time Blocking

Allocating specific time periods to particular activities prevents task fragmentation and improves focus. For engineering projects, this might involve designating mornings for design review and afternoons for supplier coordination.

### 2.4 Measuring Progress

Effective time management requires systematic progress measurement:

**Milestone tracking:** Comparing actual completion dates against planned milestones

**Earned Value Management (EVM):** Quantifying progress by comparing planned value, earned value, and actual cost

**Burndown charts:** Visualising remaining work over time

### 2.5 Keeping Projects On Track

When delays occur, project managers must respond decisively:

**Compression techniques:**
- **Fast-tracking**: Overlapping activities normally done in sequence
- **Crashing**: Adding resources to critical activities

**Scope management:**
- Prioritising essential deliverables
- Negotiating deadline extensions for non-critical items

**Communication:**
- Informing stakeholders promptly about delays
- Managing expectations realistically

### 2.6 Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Reduces stress through structured approach
- Increases productivity and output
- Enhances reputation for reliability
- Enables better resource utilisation (Maylor, 2010)

**Limitations:**
- Requires discipline and consistency
- Can become overly rigid
- Time spent on time management itself
- Not all delays are controllable

### 2.7 Consequences of Poor Time Management

Projects lacking effective time management suffer from:

- Chronic delays creating cascade effects
- Budget overruns due to extended timelines
- Resource contention and conflicts
- Stakeholder frustration and lost confidence
- Rushed work compromising quality

**Example**: The Sydney Opera House, though ultimately an architectural triumph, experienced massive delays. Initial completion was estimated at four years; actual construction took fourteen years, primarily due to poor time management and unrealistic initial scheduling (Murray, 2004).

## 3. Decision-Making and Problem Solving (10 minutes)

**LO2.2 (Decision-making)**

### 3.1 The Project Manager as Decision-Maker

Project managers make numerous decisions daily, ranging from minor operational choices to strategic direction changes. Decision-making quality directly impacts project outcomes, making this a critical competency (Heldman, 2018).

### 3.2 Critical Thinking Framework

Critical thinking involves systematic analysis before reaching conclusions:

**Steps in critical thinking:**
1. **Define the problem clearly**: Distinguish symptoms from root causes
2. **Gather relevant information**: Collect data from credible sources
3. **Identify alternatives**: Generate multiple possible solutions
4. **Evaluate options**: Assess pros and cons systematically
5. **Select and implement**: Choose optimal solution and execute
6. **Review outcomes**: Learn from results

### 3.3 Problem-Solving Methodologies

#### Root Cause Analysis

The "5 Whys" technique drills down to underlying causes:

**Example:**
- Problem: Manufacturing defect rate increased
- Why? Quality inspections were reduced
- Why? Inspector was reassigned
- Why? Staffing shortage occurred
- Why? Budget cuts were implemented
- Why? Project costs exceeded estimates

This reveals the root cause: inadequate cost management, not simply inspection procedures.

#### Decision Matrix

For comparing multiple options against weighted criteria:

```
Criteria          | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C
------------------|--------|----------|----------|----------
Cost              | 0.3    | 8        | 6        | 7
Schedule          | 0.25   | 7        | 8        | 6
Technical risk    | 0.25   | 6        | 7        | 9
Quality           | 0.2    | 9        | 7        | 8
------------------|--------|----------|----------|----------
Weighted Score    |        | 7.45     | 7.00     | 7.40
```

This quantitative approach reduces bias and facilitates transparent decision-making.

#### Pareto Analysis

The 80/20 principle suggests that 80% of problems stem from 20% of causes. Identifying these critical few enables efficient problem resolution (Juran and Godfrey, 1999).

### 3.4 Balancing Analytical and Intuitive Approaches

Whilst analytical methods provide structure, experienced project managers also develop intuition through pattern recognition. Effective decision-making combines both approaches:

- Use analytical methods for high-stakes, complex decisions
- Employ intuition for time-pressured, familiar situations
- Validate intuitive decisions against available data

### 3.5 Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Increases decision quality and consistency
- Reduces emotional and political influence
- Creates audit trail for accountability
- Builds team confidence in leadership (Patton, 2003)

**Limitations:**
- Can slow decision-making process
- Requires comprehensive information (not always available)
- Some situations demand rapid response
- Analysis paralysis risk

### 3.6 Consequences of Poor Decision-Making

Inadequate decision-making results in:

- Rework and wasted resources
- Lowered team morale
- Loss of stakeholder confidence
- Project delays and cost increases
- Safety or quality compromises

**Recommendation**: Establish decision-making frameworks appropriate to decision magnitude. Routine operational decisions may follow streamlined processes, whilst strategic choices warrant comprehensive analysis.

## 4. Delegation Principles (10 minutes)

**LO2.2 (Delegation)**

### 4.1 Understanding Delegation

Delegation involves assigning responsibility and authority for specific tasks to others whilst retaining overall accountability. It represents one of the most powerful yet underutilised skills in project management (Burke, 2013).

Many project managers struggle with delegation, either attempting to perform all tasks themselves or delegating ineffectively. Both extremes compromise project success.

### 4.2 Why Delegation Matters

**Benefits of effective delegation:**
- **Capacity multiplication**: Enables accomplishment of more work than individual capacity permits
- **Development opportunity**: Builds team members' skills and confidence
- **Motivation enhancement**: Demonstrates trust and provides challenges
- **Focus optimisation**: Allows project managers to concentrate on high-value activities
- **Succession planning**: Prepares others for leadership roles

### 4.3 What to Delegate

Project managers should delegate:

- Tasks others can perform adequately
- Activities that develop team members' capabilities
- Routine or repetitive work
- Tasks where team members possess superior expertise
- Work that isn't specifically designated to project manager role

Project managers should typically retain:

- Strategic decisions affecting overall project direction
- Personnel evaluations and discipline
- Critical stakeholder relationships
- High-risk activities requiring senior judgment
- Confidential or sensitive matters

### 4.4 The Delegation Process

Effective delegation follows a structured approach:

#### Step 1: Select the Right Person

Consider:
- Required skills and knowledge
- Current workload and availability
- Development needs and career interests
- Demonstrated reliability

#### Step 2: Clearly Define the Task

Specify:
- Desired outcomes (not just activities)
- Available resources
- Constraints and boundaries
- Deadlines and milestones
- Reporting requirements

#### Step 3: Provide Authority

Delegation without authority undermines effectiveness. Ensure the individual has:
- Decision-making power within defined scope
- Access to necessary resources
- Support from other team members
- Protection from interference

#### Step 4: Monitor Progress Without Micromanaging

Establish checkpoints but avoid excessive oversight. Trust delegates to execute whilst remaining available for support (Heagney, 2016).

#### Step 5: Provide Feedback

Recognise achievements and address issues constructively.

### 4.5 Common Delegation Barriers

Project managers often resist delegation due to:

**"I can do it faster myself":** True initially but prevents capacity building

**"They won't do it properly":** Reflects need for better training and communication

**"I enjoy this task":** Personal preference shouldn't override project needs

**"It's too complex to explain":** Indicates insufficient task structure

### 4.6 Delegation Frameworks

The Situational Leadership model suggests tailoring delegation approach to individual competence and commitment:

- **Direct**: High direction, low support (new team members)
- **Coach**: High direction, high support (developing competence)
- **Support**: Low direction, high support (capable but uncertain)
- **Delegate**: Low direction, low support (highly capable and committed)

(Hersey and Blanchard, 1993)

### 4.7 Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Dramatically increases project capacity
- Develops organisational capability
- Improves morale and engagement
- Enables focus on strategic activities (Verzuh, 2015)

**Limitations:**
- Requires time investment in explanation and training
- Involves accepting different approaches to tasks
- Carries risk if delegates lack capacity
- Can create coordination complexity

### 4.8 Consequences of Poor Delegation

Failure to delegate effectively results in:

- Project manager burnout and bottlenecks
- Underutilised team talent
- Missed deadlines due to capacity constraints
- Team member disengagement
- Failure to develop organisational capability

**Example**: A manufacturing project manager who insisted on personally approving all supplier invoices created a processing backlog that delayed payments, damaged supplier relationships, and ultimately affected material delivery schedules. Delegating invoice approval authority to the procurement officer resolved the bottleneck.

## 5. Information Management (8 minutes)

**LO2.2 (Information management)**

### 5.1 The Role of Information in Project Management

Projects generate and consume vast quantities of information. Effective information management—collecting, organising, analysing, and disseminating data—enables informed decision-making and maintains project control (Wysocki, 2019).

Information management in project contexts encompasses three primary domains:

1. **Cost control**: Tracking expenditure against budget
2. **Risk mitigation**: Monitoring and responding to threats
3. **Performance assessment**: Measuring progress and quality

### 5.2 Cost Control Through Information Management

Effective cost management depends on timely, accurate information:

**Budget tracking systems** should capture:
- Committed costs (contractual obligations)
- Actual expenditure (payments made)
- Projected costs (forecasts to completion)
- Variance analysis (planned versus actual)

**Example**: An engineering firm implementing a new design software system established weekly cost reporting. This revealed that training costs were tracking 40% above budget by week three, enabling early corrective action through modified training delivery methods rather than discovering the overrun at project end.

### 5.3 Risk Mitigation

Information management supports risk management by:

**Identifying emerging risks**: Systematic data collection reveals trends indicating potential problems

**Quantifying risk exposure**: Assessing probability and impact requires reliable information

**Monitoring risk indicators**: Tracking metrics that signal increasing risk levels

**Evaluating mitigation effectiveness**: Measuring whether risk responses achieve intended results

Risk registers, when properly maintained and reviewed, exemplify effective information management for risk mitigation (Project Management Institute, 2017).

### 5.4 Performance Assessment

Project performance cannot be evaluated without good information:

**Key performance indicators (KPIs)** might include:
- Schedule variance: Are activities completed on time?
- Cost variance: Is expenditure aligned with budget?
- Quality metrics: Do deliverables meet specifications?
- Resource utilisation: Are resources deployed efficiently?
- Stakeholder satisfaction: Are expectations being met?

### 5.5 Information Management Tools and Techniques

#### Project Management Information Systems (PMIS)

Software tools facilitate information management:
- Centralised data repositories
- Real-time reporting capabilities
- Automated alerts for exceptions
- Historical data for analysis

#### Reporting Structures

Effective reporting matches information needs to stakeholder requirements:

**Executive dashboards**: High-level summaries of key metrics

**Detailed status reports**: Comprehensive information for project team

**Exception reports**: Highlighting items requiring attention

**Trend analysis**: Tracking performance over time

### 5.6 Information Quality

Information utility depends on quality characteristics (Kerzner, 2017):

- **Accuracy**: Free from errors
- **Timeliness**: Available when needed
- **Completeness**: Includes all relevant data
- **Relevance**: Pertinent to decisions
- **Accessibility**: Available to appropriate users

### 5.7 Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Enables data-driven decisions
- Provides early warning of problems
- Facilitates transparent communication
- Creates organisational learning (Wysocki, 2019)

**Limitations:**
- Can generate information overload
- Systems require investment to establish and maintain
- Quality depends on input discipline
- Risk of focusing on measurable rather than important

### 5.8 Consequences of Poor Information Management

Projects lacking effective information management suffer from:

- Late discovery of problems
- Inability to answer stakeholder questions
- Decisions based on assumptions rather than facts
- Repeated mistakes due to lost learning
- Compliance and audit issues

**Recommendation**: Establish information management systems scaled appropriately to project size and complexity. Small projects may require only spreadsheets and simple databases, whilst large programmes need comprehensive integrated systems.

## Conclusion and Summary (2 minutes)

**LO2.2**

This lecture has explored five essential project management skills that form the operational foundation of effective project delivery. These competencies are interconnected: planning enables effective time management; time management creates space for thoughtful decision-making; delegation increases capacity for information management; and information management supports all other activities.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Planning** transforms objectives into actionable steps but requires balance between detail and flexibility

2. **Time management** represents irreplaceable resource management requiring estimation accuracy, progress tracking, and proactive adjustment

3. **Decision-making** benefits from structured critical thinking frameworks whilst acknowledging intuition's role

4. **Delegation** multiplies capacity and develops teams but demands trust and clear communication

5. **Information management** enables control through cost tracking, risk monitoring, and performance assessment

The consequences of lacking these skills are severe: delays, cost overruns, quality compromises, and stakeholder dissatisfaction. Conversely, mastering these competencies positions project managers to navigate complexity successfully and deliver projects that meet objectives.

Engineering projects will inevitably encounter challenges. Project managers equipped with strong planning, time management, decision-making, delegation, and information management skills possess the tools to respond effectively and maintain progress towards project goals.

**Preparation for workshop:** Following the break, learners will participate in a time management simulation that applies the principles covered in this lecture to realistic project scenarios. This activity will reinforce understanding and develop practical application skills.
