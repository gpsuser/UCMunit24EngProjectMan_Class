## Activity 1: Priority Matrix Exercise (8 minutes)

**Learning Outcome: LO2.2 (Planning, Time Management)**  
**Duration: 8 minutes**

### Objective

You will apply the Eisenhower Priority Matrix to categorise project tasks and make time allocation decisions. This exercise helps you distinguish between tasks that are urgent, important, both, or neither.

### Background Information You Need to Know

You are the project manager for the design and prototype development of a new robotic assembly arm for automotive manufacturing. Think of this as a mechanical device that will pick up and position car components on an assembly line. The project is in week 8 of a 16-week timeline, which means you are halfway through the project and moving into the execution phase where the prototype is being built.

### Assumptions You Should Make

For this exercise, please assume the following:
- You have a 40-hour working week available (8 hours per day, 5 days per week)
- Your project is on schedule currently, but any delays to critical tasks could jeopardise the timeline
- You have a small team that reports to you, so some tasks could potentially be delegated
- The project sponsor (the senior manager who authorised this project) expects regular updates
- Today is Monday morning of Week 8

### Your Task List

You have identified the following 12 tasks that require attention this week. Read through each one carefully:

1. **Resolve technical issue with gripper mechanism** - The production prototype is not gripping components reliably; your design team is waiting for your input before they can proceed with testing

2. **Attend monthly departmental meeting** - A routine status update meeting scheduled by senior management where all project managers report progress

3. **Review and approve supplier quotations** - Three suppliers have submitted proposals for hydraulic components that you need for the final prototype; these quotations expire on Friday

4. **Complete online timesheet** - Company policy requires weekly submission; yours is overdue by 2 days and HR has sent a reminder email

5. **Develop contingency plan for potential material shortage** - Your aluminium alloy supplier has warned of possible delays in 4 weeks, and you need to plan alternative options

6. **Respond to project sponsor's email** - Your sponsor sent an email yesterday requesting an updated cost projection for the remaining 8 weeks

7. **Conduct design review meeting** - A scheduled session with your engineering team to validate the control system design before manufacturing begins

8. **Investigate new CAD software demonstration** - A software vendor is offering a free trial of advanced simulation tools that might benefit future projects

9. **Update project schedule** - Several activities have shifted by a few days; your project schedule needs revision to reflect current status

10. **Prepare presentation for industry conference** - You have received an invitation to present your project at an industry conference in 3 months

11. **Interview candidate for vacant technician position** - HR has scheduled an interview for Thursday to fill a position in your team

12. **Read industry journal articles** - You have saved three relevant articles on robotic manufacturing innovations that you want to review

### Understanding the Priority Matrix

Before you begin, let me explain how the matrix works. The Eisenhower Priority Matrix divides tasks into four quadrants based on two factors:

**Urgency** means the task has a deadline or time pressure. If you delay it, there will be immediate consequences. For example, if supplier quotations expire on Friday, that task is urgent.

**Importance** means the task significantly contributes to your project objectives and has meaningful consequences. For example, resolving technical issues that block your team's progress is important because it directly affects project success.

Here is the matrix structure you will use:

```
┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│   URGENT & IMPORTANT    │  NOT URGENT BUT         │
│                         │  IMPORTANT              │
│   Do First (Quadrant 1) │  Schedule (Quadrant 2)  │
│                         │                         │
│   These need immediate  │  These are important    │
│   attention this week   │  but can be planned     │
│                         │                         │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│   URGENT BUT NOT        │  NOT URGENT &           │
│   IMPORTANT             │  NOT IMPORTANT          │
│                         │                         │
│   Delegate (Quadrant 3) │  Eliminate (Quadrant 4) │
│                         │                         │
│   Someone else could    │  These add little value │
│   handle these          │  and can be minimised   │
│                         │                         │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

### Hint: Questions to Ask Yourself

For each task, ask yourself these questions:

**To determine if it is urgent:**
- Does this have a deadline this week?
- Will there be immediate negative consequences if I delay it?
- Is someone waiting on me to complete this?

**To determine if it is important:**
- Does this directly contribute to project success?
- Would failure to do this well have significant consequences?
- Is this aligned with my project objectives?

### Example: How to Classify a Task

Thinking through one task as an example:

**Task 3: Review and approve supplier quotations**

**Is it urgent?** Yes, because the quotations expire Friday. If you do not approve them by Friday, you will need to request new quotations, which could delay procurement.

**Is it important?** Yes, because these hydraulic components are needed for the final prototype. Choosing the wrong supplier or delaying this decision could affect quality, cost, or schedule.

**Therefore:** This task belongs in **Quadrant 1 (Urgent & Important - Do First)**

### Instructions for You

**Step 1 (5 minutes):** Working individually, classify each of the 12 tasks by writing the task number in the appropriate quadrant of your matrix. Think carefully about each one using the questions provided above.

**Step 2 (2 minutes):** For any tasks you placed in Quadrant 3 (Urgent but Not Important - Delegate), identify to whom you might delegate each task. Consider who in your project team would be appropriate and briefly note why. For example, you might write "Task 4 - Delegate to team administrator because this is an administrative task that does not require project manager judgment."

**Step 3 (1 minute):** Review your completed matrix. Does it make sense? Have you identified clear priorities? If you could only complete four tasks this week, which quadrant would they come from?

### Hints for Common Challenges

If you are finding it difficult to classify certain tasks, consider these hints:

**For Task 2 (departmental meeting):** Meetings that are scheduled may feel urgent, but are they important to your project success? Could someone else attend on your behalf?

**For Task 4 (timesheet):** Administrative tasks that are overdue feel urgent. But do they contribute significantly to your project objectives? Could they be delegated?

**For Task 5 (contingency plan):** The material shortage might happen in 4 weeks, not this week. Does this make it urgent right now?

**For Task 10 (conference presentation):** The conference is 3 months away. Does this need attention this week?

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this activity, you should have a clear visual representation of your priorities. Most project managers find that Quadrant 1 typically contains 3-5 tasks, Quadrant 2 contains another 3-5 tasks, and Quadrants 3 and 4 contain the remainder. If you have placed more than 6 tasks in Quadrant 1, you may be overestimating urgency.

## Activity 2: Time Management Simulation (12 minutes)

**Learning Outcome: LO2.2 (Time Management, Decision-Making)**  
**Duration: 12 minutes**

### Objective

You will make time management decisions under realistic constraints, practising estimation, prioritisation, and schedule adjustment. This activity simulates what happens when unexpected problems occur during a project.

### Background Information You Need to Know

You are managing a 6-week engineering project to design and test a new brake system component for commercial vehicles. Think of this as a safety-critical part that needs rigorous testing before it can be approved for production. The project is currently in Week 4 (Wednesday morning), which means you have 2.5 weeks remaining before the final deadline.

### Your Project Team

**Design Engineer (Sarah):** Works 40 hours per week (full-time). She is responsible for all design work and creating manufacturing drawings. Assume she is capable of CAD work but it is not her primary skill.

**Test Engineer (James):** Works 40 hours per week (full-time). He is responsible for setting up test equipment and conducting all testing activities.

**CAD Technician (Maria):** Works 20 hours per week (part-time, usually Monday-Wednesday). She is the CAD specialist and much faster at CAD work than Sarah.

**You (Project Manager):** Work 40 hours per week. You are responsible for overall coordination, stakeholder communication, and final reporting.

### Assumptions You Should Make

For this exercise, assume:
- Each working day is 8 hours
- A working week is 5 days (Monday to Friday)
- Team members work at the hours stated above and cannot easily add overtime due to other commitments
- The external supplier operates on business days only (Monday to Friday)
- The client expects delivery by end of Week 6 (Friday afternoon)
- All time estimates provided are realistic and should not be reduced unless you explicitly decide to compress activities
- You are starting Wednesday morning of Week 4, so you have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday left this week, then all of Week 5, then all of Week 6

### Current Project Status

**Completed activities:**
- Initial design concepts (finished Week 1)
- Material selection (finished Week 2)
- CAD modelling (currently 80% complete)

### Remaining Activities Table

Study this table carefully. The dependencies column is particularly important:

| Activity Code | Activity Name | Assigned To | Estimated Duration | Dependencies | Important Notes |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| A | Complete CAD models | Maria | 8 hours | None | Must be done before manufacturing drawings |
| B | Manufacturing drawings | Sarah | 12 hours | A must be finished | Required before supplier can start |
| C | Prototype production | External supplier | 5 working days | B must be submitted | Supplier lead time after receiving drawings |
| D | Test rig setup | James | 16 hours | None | Can start immediately |
| E | Test procedure documentation | James | 8 hours | None | Must be ready before testing begins |
| F | Prototype testing | James | 24 hours | C, D, and E all finished | Three full days of testing |
| G | Test report | James | 8 hours | F must be finished | Documentation of results |
| H | Design modifications (if needed) | Sarah | 16 hours | G must be finished | Contingency activity |
| I | Final project report | You | 12 hours | G must be finished | Due end of Week 6 |
| J | Client presentation | You and Sarah | 4 hours preparation | I must be finished | Scheduled Friday, Week 6 |

### Understanding Dependencies

Explaining what dependencies mean with an example.

 Activity B (manufacturing drawings) has a dependency on Activity A (complete CAD models). This means Sarah cannot start creating manufacturing drawings until Maria has finished the CAD models. The drawings are based on the CAD models, so the dependency is logical.

Another example: Activity F (prototype testing) depends on Activities C, D, and E all being finished. This means James cannot start testing until the prototype arrives from the supplier (C), the test rig is set up (D), and the test procedures are documented (E). All three must be complete.

### The Problem: Three Unexpected Events

**This morning (Wednesday, Week 4), you receive the following news:**

**Problem 1:** Maria (your CAD Technician) has called in sick with flu and will be unavailable for the remainder of this week. Assume she will return Monday of Week 5, but you need to decide what to do about the 8 hours of CAD work that was scheduled for this week.

**Problem 2:** The external supplier has just emailed to say they have a backlog and now require 7 working days (not 5 working days) to produce the prototype. This is a 40% increase in their lead time.

**Problem 3:** The client has requested an interim progress meeting for Monday of Week 5. Preparing for this meeting will require 3 hours of work (2 hours from you, 1 hour from Sarah).

### Understanding the Critical Path

Before you start solving this problem, you need to understand which activities form the critical path. The critical path is the sequence of activities that determines the minimum time needed to complete the project. If any activity on the critical path is delayed, the entire project is delayed.

Looking at the dependencies, the critical path for this project is:
**A → B → C → F → G → I → J**

This is because each activity in this sequence must wait for the previous one to finish. Activities D and E are not on the critical path because they can happen in parallel with other work.

### Hint: Calculating Time Available

Understandin time available:

**Week 4 remaining:** Wednesday (today), Thursday, Friday = 3 days = 24 hours per full-time person
**Week 5:** Monday through Friday = 5 days = 40 hours per full-time person  
**Week 6:** Monday through Friday = 5 days = 40 hours per full-time person
**Total:** 13 working days remaining

### Your Challenge

You need to develop a response plan. Work through this systematically by addressing each question below:

**Question 1: Immediate Action on Maria's Absence (2 minutes)**

Maria's CAD work (Activity A) is on the critical path. You have three options:

**Option A:** Ask Sarah to complete the CAD work (8 hours). Sarah is capable but slower than Maria at CAD.

**Option B:** Try to hire a temporary CAD contractor for the remainder of the week. This would cost approximately £250 per day and might take a day to arrange.

**Option C:** Wait for Maria to return Monday Week 5, which means Activity A will be delayed by 3 working days.

Which option do you choose and why? Consider the impact on the critical path. Write your decision and brief justification (2-3 sentences).

**Hint:** Think about which activities are waiting for Activity A to finish. How does each option affect Activity B and therefore Activity C?

**Question 2: Schedule Impact Calculation (3 minutes)**

Now calculate the time impact of the supplier delay. Originally, Activity C (prototype production) was 5 working days. It is now 7 working days. That is an additional 2 working days added to your critical path.

Calculate your new completion timeline. 

Help to structure this:

**Step 1:** Based on your answer to Question 1, when will Activity A be completed?

**Step 2:** When can Activity B (manufacturing drawings, 12 hours) start and finish? Remember, this can only start when Activity A is done, and Sarah needs 12 hours to complete it.

**Step 3:** When can the supplier start? Remember, they need the completed drawings from Activity B.

**Step 4:** When will the supplier finish? They now need 7 working days from when they receive the drawings.

**Step 5:** When can Activity F (testing, 24 hours) start? Remember, it needs the prototype from the supplier (C), plus Activities D and E to be complete. Assume D and E can be finished by end of Week 4 since James can start them now.

Work through these steps and determine: **Will you meet the Week 6 Friday deadline?** Show your calculations.

**Example Calculation Format:**
```
Activity A finishes: [Day]
Activity B starts: [Day], finishes: [Day]
Supplier starts: [Day], finishes: [Day]
Activity F starts: [Day], finishes: [Day]
etc.
```

**Question 3: Fast-Tracking Opportunities (2 minutes)**

Fast-tracking means overlapping activities that would normally be done in sequence. This can save time but usually increases risk.

Identify one fast-tracking opportunity in this project. For example, could you ask Sarah to start creating some of the manufacturing drawings before Maria completely finishes the CAD work? What would be the benefit (time saved) and what would be the risk (what could go wrong)?

Write your answer as: "I could fast-track [activities] by [approach]. This would save [time] but risks [potential problem]."

**Question 4: Resource Reallocation for Client Meeting (2 minutes)**

The client meeting requires 3 hours of preparation (2 hours from you, 1 hour from Sarah). Given that your schedule is already under pressure, when should this preparation happen and what might you need to defer or compress to accommodate it?

Consider: Should you prepare on Thursday/Friday of Week 4 or over the weekend or on Monday morning before the meeting?

**Question 5: Communication Plan (3 minutes)**

You need to communicate with your project sponsor about these challenges. Draft a brief status update (bullet points are fine) that includes:

- Current situation (the three problems)
- Impact on timeline (your calculation from Question 2)
- Your mitigation actions (your decisions from Questions 1, 3, 4)
- Revised delivery date or request for deadline extension if needed

**Hint:** Good communication is honest but solution-focused. Do not just present problems; present problems with your proposed solutions.

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this activity, you should understand how to:
- Calculate the impact of delays on a critical path
- Evaluate options for responding to unexpected problems
- Balance multiple competing constraints
- Communicate effectively about schedule challenges

Most realistic solutions will require either:
- A small deadline extension (1-3 days)
- Scope reduction (fewer tests or shorter report)
- Fast-tracking with accepted risks
- Resource addition (hiring temporary help)

## Activity 3: Delegation Decision Exercise (5 minutes)

**Learning Outcome: LO2.2 (Delegation)**  
**Duration: 5 minutes**

### Objective

You will apply delegation principles to determine which tasks to delegate and to whom, matching tasks to team members based on their skills, experience, and current workload.

### Background Information You Need to Know

You are the project manager for an environmental monitoring system installation at a water treatment facility. This involves installing sensors throughout the facility to monitor water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, and contamination levels. The data will be transmitted via a computer network to a central monitoring station.

### Assumptions You Should Make

For this exercise, assume:
- It is Monday morning and you are planning your work for the week
- You have approximately 30 hours available for project work this week (some time is taken by routine management duties)
- All team members are available and not on holiday
- The project is in the execution phase (equipment is being installed)
- You are accountable for all work quality, even if you delegate tasks

### Your Team Members

Read these descriptions carefully, as each person has different strengths, experience levels, and availability:

**Alex (Senior Engineer):**
- 15 years of experience in engineering projects
- Highly competent technically across most areas
- Currently working at 95% capacity (very busy with other tasks)
- Strong technical skills in design, analysis, and review work
- Prefers interesting, challenging work over routine tasks
- Good leadership potential but has never led a team meeting

**Jordan (Junior Engineer):**
- 2 years of experience since graduating
- Eager to develop skills and take on new responsibilities
- Currently at 60% capacity (has time available)
- Good technical foundation and learns quickly
- Needs guidance and occasional supervision
- Comfortable with both technical and administrative tasks
- Has never prepared a project board report before

**Sam (Technician):**
- 5 years of experience in practical installation and commissioning
- Excellent at hands-on implementation work
- Currently at 75% capacity (has some time available)
- Prefers practical, hands-on work to documentation
- Less comfortable with written reports and administrative tasks
- Very reliable for practical assignments
- Has extensive experience with sensor installation

**Chris (Contractor):**
- Specialist in data communications and network integration
- Hired for 3 months specifically for the networking aspects of this project
- Currently at 80% capacity (has limited time available)
- Highly skilled in his narrow domain (networking) but not in other areas
- Expensive hourly rate means he should focus on specialist work
- Available only until end of his contract in 2 months

### Your Task List for This Week

You have eight tasks that need attention this week:

**Task A: Lead weekly team meeting (2 hours)**
A standard project status update meeting with all four team members. The agenda includes reviewing progress, discussing upcoming activities, and addressing any issues. The meeting happens every Monday afternoon.

**Task B: Review and approve 30-page technical specification document (4 hours)**
This is a critical document that defines exactly how the monitoring system will operate. It will be used by contractors and other engineers. Any errors could cause significant rework. The document requires senior technical judgment to review properly.

**Task C: Install and configure monitoring sensors (8 hours)**
Physical installation work at the water treatment facility. This requires climbing ladders, following installation procedures, and configuring sensor settings. It is moderately complex work requiring technical knowledge and practical skills. There are 12 sensors to install across two days.

**Task D: Prepare routine monthly progress report for project board (3 hours)**
The project board (senior managers who oversee the project) requires a monthly report. You have a template to follow. The report needs updates on schedule, budget, risks, and quality. It is important for governance but the format is well-defined and straightforward.

**Task E: Troubleshoot network connectivity issues (6 hours)**
The monitoring sensors need to communicate with the central station via the computer network. Some sensors are not connecting properly. This requires specialist knowledge of network protocols, IP addressing, and data communications. The problem is preventing the system from being tested.

**Task F: Update project risk register (2 hours)**
The risk register is a document listing all potential problems that could affect the project. It needs to be reviewed every two weeks to add new risks, update the status of existing risks, and document any mitigation actions taken. This is an administrative but important task.

**Task G: Mentor junior engineer on equipment calibration procedures (3 hours)**
Jordan needs to learn how to calibrate the monitoring sensors properly. This involves hands-on training and demonstration. You are the most experienced person in calibration procedures on your team.

**Task H: Attend mandatory site safety briefing (1 hour)**
Everyone working on site must attend a safety briefing covering hazards, emergency procedures, and site rules. This is a regulatory compliance requirement. The briefing is on Wednesday morning.

### Understanding Delegation Principles

Before you complete this exercise, here is an explanation of the key principles:

**Delegation is not dumping:** You should not delegate only boring or unpleasant tasks while keeping all interesting work for yourself. Good delegation includes developmental opportunities.

**Match tasks to capabilities:** Different team members have different strengths. A task that is too easy provides no development; a task that is too difficult sets the person up for failure.

**Consider workload:** If someone is already at 95% capacity, adding more tasks may be unfair or unrealistic.

**Supervision varies:** Some tasks require close supervision (checking in regularly), others require only light supervision (checking the final result).

**You remain accountable:** Even if you delegate a task, you are still responsible for its quality and completion. This is why supervision is important.

### Hint: Questions to Ask Yourself

For each task, ask:

**Can I delegate this?**
- Does it require my specific authority or judgment?
- Is it too high-risk to delegate?
- Is there someone capable of doing it?

**Who should I delegate to?**
- Who has the required skills or could develop them?
- Who has capacity (time available)?
- Who would benefit from this experience?

**How much supervision is needed?**
- High supervision: Check-ins every few hours, detailed guidance
- Medium supervision: Check-in midway and review final output  
- Low supervision: Brief at start, review final output only

### Example: How to Analyse a Task

Thinking through one task:

**Task H: Attend site safety briefing (1 hour)**

**Can I delegate this?** Yes. The briefing is mandatory for anyone working on site, but it does not require my attendance specifically. Any team member can attend.

**Who should attend?** Sam or Jordan would be appropriate since they will be working on site. Sam is doing the sensor installation (Task C), so he definitely needs to attend. It makes sense for Sam to go.

**Supervision needed?** None. This is simply attendance at a briefing.

**Decision:** Delegate Task H to Sam. No supervision required.

### Instructions for You

**Step 1 (3 minutes):** For each task (A through H), make a decision:
- **KEEP** (I must do this myself) or **DELEGATE** (assign to someone else)

If you choose to delegate, identify:
- **To whom** (Alex, Jordan, Sam, or Chris)
- **Why this person is appropriate** (brief reason based on their skills, experience, or capacity)
- **Supervision level** (High, Medium, Low, or None)

Use this format for your answers:

```
Task A: [KEEP or DELEGATE]
If delegate: To [Name] because [reason]. Supervision: [level]

Task B: [KEEP or DELEGATE]
If delegate: To [Name] because [reason]. Supervision: [level]

[Continue for all tasks]
```

**Step 2 (1 minute):** Calculate the total hours for tasks you decided to keep. Add them up. Remember, you only have approximately 30 hours available this week. If your total exceeds 30 hours, you need to reconsider some decisions. Which additional tasks could you delegate?

**Step 3 (1 minute):** Review your delegation decisions. Have you:
- Given Jordan any developmental opportunities?
- Used Chris for specialist networking work?
- Avoided overloading Alex who is already at 95% capacity?
- Matched practical tasks to Sam's strengths?

### Hints for Specific Tasks

**For Task A (team meeting):** Who could develop leadership skills by facilitating this meeting? Could you attend but not lead?

**For Task B (technical specification):** This is high-risk and requires senior judgment. Is anyone else qualified enough?

**For Task C (sensor installation):** Who excels at practical, hands-on work?

**For Task D (progress report):** Could this be a good learning opportunity for someone? Would you need to review their draft?

**For Task E (network troubleshooting):** Who is the specialist in networking? Even if this is important work, who can do it best?

**For Task F (risk register):** This is administrative but requires understanding the project. Who could learn from doing this with supervision?

**For Task G (mentoring):** Could someone else mentor Jordan, or do you have unique knowledge?

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this activity, you should have a delegation plan that:
- Keeps 7-12 hours of work for yourself (feasible within your 30-hour availability)
- Delegates 17-22 hours of work to your team
- Balances development opportunities with task urgency
- Matches tasks to team member strengths and capacity
- Includes appropriate supervision levels

Most project managers find they should keep only 2-3 tasks themselves (typically the highest-risk or most senior-judgment tasks) and delegate the remaining 5-6 tasks.
