## Workshop Overview

**Week Focus**: Introduction & Project Initiation  
**Learning Outcomes**: LO1.1 (The stages of project management)  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Total Marks**: 35 marks

This workshop contains three sections designed to develop your understanding of project management stages and the project initiation phase:

- **Section A**: Past examination questions (verbatim)
- **Section B**: Adapted examination questions  
- **Section C**: New application questions

---

## SECTION A: Past Examination Questions (Verbatim)

These questions are taken directly from previous examination papers. They represent the standard and style of questions you can expect in the external assessment.

---

### Question A1 (3 marks)
**Source: January 2023 Examination, Question 1(e)**

The table below shows four activities that could be undertaken during an engineering project.

Complete the table by placing a tick (✓) in the correct box to show the project management stage when each activity is most likely to occur.

| Activity | Initiation | Planning | Implementation | Closure |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Taking corrective action when an issue arises | | | | |
| Obtaining acceptance that the project is complete | | | | |
| Identifying who will be responsible for managing specific risks | | | | |

**[3 marks]**

### Question A2 (4 marks)
**Source: January 2024 Examination, Question 1(a)**

The table below shows four activities that a project manager might undertake.

Complete the table by placing a tick (✓) in the correct box to show the project management stage when each activity would most likely occur.

| Activity | Initiation | Planning | Implementation | Closure |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Identify project control strategies (time, cost, quality) | | | | |
| Monitor project quality against targets | | | | |
| Recognise project successes and failures | | | | |
| Provide frequent updates on project execution | | | | |

**[4 marks]**

## SECTION B: Adapted Examination Questions

These questions are based on past examination questions but have been modified to provide additional practice with similar concepts.

---

### Question B1 (3 marks)

The following activities occur during different stages of a project to install new automated assembly equipment in a manufacturing facility.

Match each activity to the correct project management stage by placing a tick (✓) in the appropriate box.

| Activity | Initiation | Planning | Implementation | Closure |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Conducting a feasibility study to determine if the automation project is viable | | | | |
| Creating a detailed project schedule showing the sequence and timing of installation tasks | | | | |
| Documenting lessons learned about the equipment installation process | | | | |

**[3 marks]**

### Question B2 (4 marks)

An aerospace engineering company is developing a new lightweight composite wing component. The table below shows activities that will occur during this project.

For each activity, identify the project management stage where it would most appropriately occur by placing a tick (✓) in the correct column.

| Activity | Initiation | Planning | Implementation | Closure |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Develop the project proposal outlining the purpose and scope of the composite wing development | | | | |
| Conduct stakeholder analysis to identify who has power and interest in the project | | | | |
| Approve design changes and take corrective action when material test results are unsatisfactory | | | | |
| Produce the final project report summarising performance against objectives | | | | |

## SECTION C: New Application Questions

These questions are designed to test your understanding of concepts introduced in this week's lecture.

---

### Question C1 (6 marks)

A civil engineering company is considering a project to construct a new pedestrian bridge across a river in a city centre location.

**(a)** Identify **three** components that should be included in the project proposal for this bridge construction project.

**[3 marks]**

**(b)** For **one** of the components you identified in part (a), explain why it is important to include this in the project proposal.

**[3 marks]**

---

### Question C2 (8 marks)

An electronics manufacturer is evaluating whether to proceed with a project to develop a new product line of wireless charging devices for electric vehicles.

During project initiation, the project manager conducts a feasibility study.

**(a)** Identify and describe **two** different types of feasibility that should be evaluated.

**[4 marks]**

**(b)** Explain why conducting a feasibility study is important before proceeding from the initiation stage to the planning stage.

**[4 marks]**

### Question C3 (7 marks)

The project management triangle represents the fundamental constraints that must be managed in any engineering project.

```
                    TIME
                     /\
                    /  \
                   /    \
                  /      \
                 /        \
                /  PROJECT \
               /   SCOPE    \
              /______________\
           COST              QUALITY
```

**(a)** State what is meant by the term **'project controls'**.

**[2 marks]**

**(b)** Explain why a project manager for a safety-critical aerospace project might prioritise **quality** as the most important control, even if this increases costs and extends timescales.

**[3 marks]**

**(c)** Describe **one** strategy a project manager could use to control **time** during a manufacturing equipment installation project.

**[2 marks]**

## Examination Technique Guidance

When answering questions about project management stages:

1. **Remember the sequence**: The four stages are consecutive and must be carried out sequentially:
   - Initiation → Planning → Implementation → Closure

2. **Understand what happens in each stage**:
   - **Initiation**: Defining the project at high level, creating proposals, conducting feasibility studies, establishing controls framework
   - **Planning**: Creating detailed plans for resources, finances, quality, risks, stakeholders, and schedules
   - **Implementation**: Executing the plan, monitoring progress, controlling changes, taking corrective action
   - **Closure**: Obtaining final acceptance, producing reports, gathering feedback, documenting lessons learned

3. **Look for key words** in activities:
   - "Feasibility", "proposal", "authorisation" → **Initiation**
   - "Detailed plan", "schedule", "stakeholder analysis", "risk analysis" → **Planning**
   - "Monitor", "control", "corrective action", "execute", "issue logs" → **Implementation**
   - "Acceptance", "lessons learned", "final report", "review" → **Closure**

4. **Read the context carefully**: Some activities could theoretically occur in multiple stages, but the question will provide context clues about which stage is most appropriate.
