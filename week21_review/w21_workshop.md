**Question 15** *(January 2023 — 3(b)(i))* — 6 marks

**Scenario Context:**

Johnny is managing a pharmaceutical equipment installation project at Better Health plc. For Activity D (Equipment Testing), he has gathered three time estimates from subject matter experts:

A project has three time estimates for Activity D:

- Optimistic time (O) = 4 days  
- Most likely time (M) = 7 days

**Question 19** *(January 2024 — 4(a)(ii))* — 3 marks

**Scenario Context:**

Charlie is managing an environmental improvement project at HD Tyre Ltd. The project team has collected water consumption data from three manufacturing sites as part of the sustainability assessment.

The data is presented in the following table:

```
Water Consumption Data - HD Tyre Ltd Manufacturing Sites

+----------+---------------------------+
|   Site   | Water Used (litres/day)   |
+----------+---------------------------+
| Site A   |        12,450             |

+----------+---------------------------+
| TOTAL    |        36,440             |
+----------+---------------------------+
```

Charlie wants to present this data graphically to the project sponsor to show which site uses the most water and should be prioritised for water reduction measures.

Recommend an appropriate graphical format and justify your choice.
