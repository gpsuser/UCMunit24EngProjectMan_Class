## Section A: Project Stages and Planning (LO1)

### Question 1 — 2 marks (June 2023 — 1(a))

**Question:** Explain two benefits to a new project manager of reviewing lessons learned from previous similar projects during the initiation stage.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | One valid benefit identified (non-contextual) |
| 2 marks | One valid benefit with contextual explanation OR two valid benefits identified |

**Acceptable Responses:**

- Helps avoid repeating past mistakes / learn from previous errors
- Identifies successful strategies that can be replicated
- Provides realistic time/cost estimates based on actual data
- Highlights potential risks specific to this type of project
- Reduces learning curve for an inexperienced project manager
- Builds confidence through understanding proven approaches

**Model Answer (2 marks):**

*One benefit is that reviewing lessons learned helps a new project manager avoid repeating mistakes made on similar projects, which is particularly valuable when they lack experience. Another benefit is that it provides realistic estimates for time and cost based on actual historical data rather than guesswork, leading to more accurate planning.*

### Question 2 — 3 marks (January 2023 — 1(b))

**Question:** Explain why time, cost, and quality controls are important to project success.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | Time control importance identified |
| 1 mark | Cost control importance identified |
| 1 mark | Quality control importance identified |

**Acceptable Responses:**

**Time:**
- Ensures project meets deadlines / stakeholder expectations
- Prevents time creep / schedule overruns
- Maintains competitive advantage / market timing
- Ensures resources remain available as planned

**Cost:**
- Prevents budget overruns / cost creep
- Ensures project remains financially viable / profitable
- Maintains stakeholder confidence / prevents funding withdrawal
- Ensures value for money is achieved

**Quality:**
- Ensures deliverables meet specifications / requirements
- Maintains customer satisfaction / prevents rework
- Protects brand reputation / organisational credibility
- Ensures compliance with standards / safety requirements

**Model Answer (3 marks):**

*Time controls are important because they ensure the project meets its deadline and stakeholders' expectations for timely delivery. Cost controls prevent budget overruns which could make the project financially unviable or lead to funding withdrawal. Quality controls ensure that deliverables meet the specified requirements and maintain customer satisfaction, avoiding expensive rework.*

### Question 3 — 4 marks (June 2025 — 1(b))

**Question:** Outline the purposes of two different types of project plan that would be created during the planning stage.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 2 marks | First plan type: 1 mark for identification + 1 mark for purpose |
| 2 marks | Second plan type: 1 mark for identification + 1 mark for purpose |

**Acceptable Plan Types and Purposes:**

| Plan Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Resource plan** | Identifies what resources are needed, where they're needed, and when they're needed |
| **Quality plan** | Defines quality targets and the methods/controls used to achieve and measure quality |
| **Project schedule** | Shows activities, their sequence/order, dependencies, and timings/durations |
| **Financial plan** | Details project budget, funding sources, cash flow, and expenditure timing |
| **Communication plan** | Specifies who needs information, what information, when, and through which channels |
| **Risk analysis** | Identifies potential risks, their likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies |

**Model Answer (4 marks):**

*A resource plan identifies what physical, technological, and human resources are needed for the project, where they will be deployed, and when they will be required. This ensures resources are available at the right time and prevents delays.*

*A quality plan defines the quality targets the project must achieve and specifies the control methods that will be used to measure and maintain quality standards. This ensures deliverables meet specifications and stakeholder expectations.*

### Question 4 — 3 marks (January 2024 — 1(b))

**Question:** A project manager has written the objective: *"Increase production efficiency within the next financial year."* Explain why this objective does not meet SMART criteria.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | Identifies one SMART criterion not met |
| 2 marks | Identifies two SMART criteria not met |
| 3 marks | Identifies three SMART criteria not met with brief explanation |

**SMART Analysis:**

| Criterion | Met? | Reason |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **S** — Specific | ❌ | No specific aspect of efficiency stated (cost, time, waste, etc.) |
| **M** — Measurable | ❌ | No numerical target / no way to quantify "increase" |
| **A** — Agreed | ✓ | Cannot determine from information given |
| **R** — Realistic | ✓ | Cannot determine from information given |
| **T** — Time-specific | ✓ | "Within the next financial year" provides time limit |

**Model Answer (3 marks):**

*The objective is not Specific because it doesn't state which aspect of efficiency should be increased (e.g., production rate, energy efficiency, material waste reduction). It is not Measurable because there is no numerical target to quantify the improvement (e.g., "by 15%"). It is also not clear whether the objective is Agreed with key stakeholders or Realistic given available resources.*

### Question 5 — 2 marks (January 2022 — 1(c)(i))

**Question:** Using the stakeholder power-interest matrix provided, rank the following stakeholders by their power level, from highest to lowest.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 marks | Fewer than 3 stakeholders correctly ranked |
| 1 mark | 3 stakeholders correctly ranked |
| 2 marks | All 4 stakeholders correctly ranked |

**Matrix Provided:**

```
INTEREST
    ^
  H |
  I |     C                S
  G |
  H |
    |
  - + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ->

    +--------------------------------
    LOW         POWER          HIGH

KEY:
A = Project Sponsor
B = Suppliers  
C = Local Community Groups
S = Government Regulatory Bodies
```

**Analysis of Matrix:**

Reading the horizontal (Power) axis from left to right:
- **LOW Power:** Local Community Groups (C)
- **MEDIUM Power:** Suppliers (B)
- **HIGH Power:** Project Sponsor (A) and Government Regulatory Bodies (S)

Within the HIGH power category:
- Government Regulatory Bodies (S) are positioned slightly to the right of Project Sponsor (A), indicating marginally higher power

**Correct Answer (2 marks):**

1. **Government Regulatory Bodies** (highest power - far right, high interest)
2. **Project Sponsor** (high power, low interest)
3. **Suppliers** (medium power, low interest)
4. **Local Community Groups** (lowest power - far left, high interest)

**Teaching Note:**

Power refers to the stakeholder's ability to influence project decisions, approve/block actions, or control resources. Students should read position from the horizontal axis. Common error: confusing interest (vertical) with power (horizontal).

**Stakeholder Management Strategy (for reference):**

```
High Interest, High Power (S): MANAGE CLOSELY
- Government Regulatory Bodies
- Engage frequently, address concerns proactively

High Interest, Low Power (C): KEEP INFORMED  
- Local Community Groups
- Regular communication, consultation

Low Interest, High Power (A): KEEP SATISFIED
- Project Sponsor
- Meet their needs, don't overwhelm with detail

Low Interest, Low Power (B): MONITOR
- Suppliers
- Minimal effort, basic communication
```

### Question 6 — 6 marks (January 2024 — 1(d))

**Question:** Outline one proactive contingency plan for each resource risk area and explain how it mitigates risk.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Risk Area | Marks | Criteria |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Physical resources | 2 marks | 1 mark for contingency plan + 1 mark for explanation |
| Technological resources | 2 marks | 1 mark for contingency plan + 1 mark for explanation |
| Human resources | 2 marks | 1 mark for contingency plan + 1 mark for explanation |

**Acceptable Responses:**

**Physical Resources:**
- Identify backup/alternative suppliers → Prevents delays if primary supplier fails
- Maintain buffer stock of critical materials → Ensures production continues during supply disruptions
- Reserve additional warehouse/storage space → Accommodates fluctuations in material delivery
- Pre-order long lead-time items → Reduces risk of procurement delays

**Technological Resources:**
- Install backup power generators → Maintains operations during power outages
- Implement cloud-based backup systems → Prevents data loss from equipment failure
- Maintain service contracts with IT support → Ensures rapid response to technical failures
- Keep older equipment as backup → Allows continued operation if new technology fails
- Install remote meeting software → Enables virtual collaboration if travel restricted

**Human Resources:**
- Identify cover personnel for key roles → Prevents project stoppage if someone is absent
- Cross-train team members → Ensures knowledge isn't lost if key person leaves
- Build relationships with recruitment agencies → Enables quick replacement of staff
- Document all processes thoroughly → Reduces dependency on individual expertise
- Arrange job-sharing for critical roles → Provides built-in redundancy

**Model Answer (6 marks):**

*(i) Physical resources:* Identify two alternative suppliers for all critical materials before the project starts. This mitigates risk because if the primary supplier fails to deliver on time or at the required quality, the project can immediately switch to a backup supplier without delays or quality compromises.

*(ii) Technological resources:* Install and test remote meeting software before it's needed for stakeholder consultations. This ensures that if travel restrictions or equipment failures prevent face-to-face meetings, the project can continue communication through virtual channels without disruption to stakeholder engagement or decision-making processes.

*(iii) Human resources:* Identify cover personnel for each key project role and brief them on responsibilities in advance. This prevents project delays if a key team member becomes unavailable due to illness, leaving the organisation, or conflicting priorities, as someone can immediately step into the role with understanding of what needs to be done.

**Common Errors:**
- Providing reactive rather than proactive plans (e.g., "deal with supplier failure when it happens")
- Not explaining HOW the plan mitigates risk
- Confusing resource categories (e.g., putting budget under physical resources)

## Section B: Project Management Roles and Skills (LO2)

### Question 7 — 2 marks (January 2025 — 1(a))

**Question:** Describe the role of a project sponsor in an engineering project.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | One valid responsibility described |
| 2 marks | Two valid responsibilities described OR one responsibility with detailed explanation |

**Acceptable Responsibilities:**

- Provides funding / secures budget / authorises expenditure
- Authorises project start / gives go-ahead / approves initiation
- Makes strategic decisions / resolves escalated issues
- Represents project at board level / senior management
- Monitors overall project performance / reviews progress
- Champions the project within the organisation
- Approves major changes / scope modifications
- Ensures project aligns with business objectives
- Accountable for project success (not responsible for delivery)

**Model Answer (2 marks):**

*The project sponsor provides the funding for the project and authorises its start. They also make strategic decisions when issues are escalated beyond the project manager's authority and represent the project's interests at senior management level.*

**Alternative Model Answer (2 marks):**

*The project sponsor is accountable for the overall success of the project and ensures it aligns with the organisation's business objectives. They champion the project within the organisation, securing necessary support and resources from senior management.*

### Question 8 — 3 marks (June 2024 — 1(b))

**Question:** Explain why a project manager needs to ensure that project team leaders understand their responsibilities.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | One valid reason with basic explanation |
| 2 marks | Two valid reasons with basic explanation |
| 3 marks | Three valid reasons OR two reasons with developed explanation |

**Acceptable Reasons:**

- Prevents duplication of effort / confusion about who does what
- Ensures all tasks are completed / nothing falls through gaps
- Enables effective delegation / PM can focus on strategic issues
- Maintains accountability / clear ownership of deliverables
- Ensures consistent communication / team members know who to report to
- Prevents conflict / reduces territorial disputes
- Enables accurate performance monitoring / review
- Ensures team leaders can make appropriate decisions within their authority
- Maintains team morale / clarity reduces stress

**Model Answer (3 marks):**

*Team leaders need to understand their responsibilities so they know exactly which tasks and team members they are accountable for, preventing confusion and ensuring nothing is overlooked. It also enables the project manager to delegate effectively, as team leaders can make decisions within their authority without constantly seeking approval, freeing the PM to focus on strategic issues. Additionally, clear responsibilities prevent conflict between team leaders about who is responsible for particular aspects of the project.*

### Question 9 — 6 marks (January 2022 — 1(a))

**Question:** Identify three leadership styles that a project manager might use and describe each style.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | First leadership style correctly identified |
| 1 mark | First leadership style adequately described |
| 1 mark | Second leadership style correctly identified |
| 1 mark | Second leadership style adequately described |
| 1 mark | Third leadership style correctly identified |
| 1 mark | Third leadership style adequately described |

**The Four Leadership Styles (Hersey-Blanchard Situational Leadership):**

```
DIRECTIVE                          SUPPORTIVE
(Telling/Commanding)               (Coaching/Selling)

- High direction, low support      - High direction, high support
- Leader decides and tells         - Leader decides but explains
- Close supervision                - Two-way communication
- Detailed instructions            - Leader persuades team
- Task-focused                     - Builds competence

Used when: Team inexperienced      Used when: Team developing skills

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

COLLABORATIVE                      RESPONSIVE
(Participating/Supporting)         (Delegating/Hands-off)

- Low direction, high support      - Low direction, low support
- Shared decision-making           - Team autonomy
- Team participates in planning    - Minimal leader intervention
- Facilitates rather than directs  - Team self-managing
- High team involvement            - Leader available if needed

Used when: Team competent but      Used when: Team highly experienced
           needs confidence                  and motivated
```

**Model Answer (6 marks):**

*Directive leadership is where the project manager makes all decisions independently and tells team members exactly what to do with close supervision, providing detailed instructions and maintaining tight control over tasks. This style is used when the team lacks experience or the situation requires immediate decisions.*

*Collaborative leadership is where the project manager shares decision-making with the team, seeking their input and ideas when planning or solving problems, facilitating discussion rather than imposing solutions. The manager provides support while the team takes ownership of decisions.*

*Responsive leadership (also called delegating) is where the project manager gives the team autonomy to make their own decisions and manage their own work, with the manager available for support if needed but not actively directing day-to-day activities. This works when the team is highly competent and motivated.*

**Acceptable Alternative Styles:**
- Supportive (coaching/selling)
- Transformational leadership
- Transactional leadership
- Autocratic/Democratic leadership

**Common Errors:**
- Confusing leadership styles with management functions
- Describing when to use without describing what the style is
- Using vague terms like "good leadership" without specifics

### Question 10 — 4 marks (January 2024 — 1(e))

**Question:** Charlie needs to negotiate with Sara (Finance Director) for additional budget and with Ben (Project Sponsor) for an extended deadline. Explain two reasons why Charlie needs to use negotiation skills.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark per reason | Generic reason (non-contextual) |
| 2 marks per reason | Contextual reason referencing the scenario |

**Acceptable Reasons (Generic — 1 mark each):**

- To gain approval for budget increase
- To secure deadline extension
- To reach mutually acceptable compromise
- To maintain stakeholder relationships
- To explain project needs/justify requests

**Acceptable Reasons (Contextual — 2 marks each):**

- Sara controls financial resources, so Charlie must negotiate to secure additional £45,000 budget rather than simply requesting it, as she will need convincing that the extra expenditure is justified for the environmental improvement project
- Ben has authority over project scope and timescale as sponsor, so Charlie must negotiate the 4-week extended deadline by explaining the reasons and reaching an agreement that balances project quality against time constraints for the carbon reduction objectives
- Charlie needs to offer something in return (e.g., enhanced deliverables, additional carbon savings, risk reduction) to persuade Sara and Ben to approve changes to the original project parameters
- The 12% carbon reduction target may be at risk without additional resources/time, so Charlie must negotiate by demonstrating the impact on project success rather than making demands

**Model Answer (4 marks):**

*Charlie needs negotiation skills with Sara because as Finance Director, she controls budget allocation and will require convincing justification for the additional £45,000 expenditure. Charlie must negotiate by explaining the benefits of the extra budget for achieving the 12% carbon reduction target and possibly offering to reduce costs elsewhere or demonstrate return on investment through energy savings.*

*Charlie also needs negotiation with Ben because as Project Sponsor, Ben has ultimate authority over the project timeline and has already agreed to a completion date with senior management. Charlie must negotiate the 4-week deadline extension by explaining the reasons for the delay, demonstrating that the carbon reduction objectives would be compromised without it, and possibly offering to prioritise certain deliverables to maintain partial on-time delivery.*

**Differentiation:**
- **1 mark:** "Needs Sara's approval for money"
- **2 marks:** "Needs to convince Sara to approve £45,000 by showing it's needed for carbon reduction targets"

---

### Question 11 — 2 marks (June 2023 — 2(b))

**Question:** Explain what is meant by 'team building' as a project management skill.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | Basic definition or one aspect explained |
| 2 marks | Comprehensive definition or two aspects explained |

**Key Aspects of Team Building:**

- Developing positive working relationships between team members
- Creating a sense of shared purpose / common goals
- Establishing trust and mutual respect
- Encouraging collaboration and cooperation
- Resolving conflicts constructively
- Motivating individuals to work together effectively
- Fostering open communication
- Building team identity / cohesion

**Model Answer (2 marks):**

*Team building is the process of developing positive working relationships between project team members to create a cohesive unit that works collaboratively towards shared objectives. It involves fostering trust, encouraging open communication, and resolving conflicts to ensure the team functions effectively together.*

**Alternative Model Answer (2 marks):**

*Team building means creating a sense of shared purpose among team members so they work together cooperatively rather than as individuals. It includes activities and strategies that build trust, mutual respect, and effective collaboration within the project team.*

**Common Errors:**
- Describing team-building activities (e.g., "paintballing") rather than the skill itself
- Confusing with team management or team leadership
- Too vague: "making the team work well" without explaining how

## Section C: Project Management Tools (LO3)

### Question 12 — 3 marks (June 2023 — 3(b))

**Question:** Complete the Gantt chart by: (i) Adding slack time for Activity F (ii) Adding one dependency arrow.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | Slack time correctly shown for Activity F |
| 2 marks | Dependency arrow correctly drawn showing F→H relationship |

                  (DEPENDENCY ARROW ADDED)

Legend:
#### = Activity duration
---- = Slack time 
---> = Dependency arrow (F must finish before H starts)
```

**Explanation:**

**(i) Slack Time for Activity F (1 mark):**
- Activity F (Staff Training) runs from Day 21 to Day 24 (4 days duration)
- The earliest it can finish: Day 24
- The latest it must finish: Day 26 (before H starts at Day 27)
- Slack time = 26 - 24 = 2 days
- Shown as dashes (--) immediately after the activity bar

**(ii) Dependency Arrow F→H (2 marks):**
- Arrow must clearly show direction from F to H
- Indicates that Activity H (Go-Live) cannot start until Activity F (Staff Training) is complete
- Arrow drawn from end of F to start of H

**Teaching Notes:**

**Slack Time Calculation:**
```
Slack = Latest Finish Time - Earliest Finish Time

For Activity F:
- EFT (Earliest Finish Time) = Day 24
- LFT (Latest Finish Time) = Day 26
- Slack = 26 - 24 = 2 days
```

**Common Errors:**
- Showing slack in wrong position (before the activity rather than after)
- Drawing arrow in wrong direction (H→F instead of F→H)
- Not showing slack visually (writing "2 days" instead of drawing it)

### Question 13 — 3 marks (January 2023 — 3(a)(ii))

**Question:** Identify three errors in the Gantt chart shown.

**Chart with Errors:**

```
Activity Data Table:
Activity              Duration    Predecessor
A: Market Research    8 days      None
B: Concept Design     5 days      A
C: Prototype Build    10 days     B
D: Lab Testing        6 days      C
E: Safety Review      4 days      D

Gantt Chart:

   Review              
```

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | Each error correctly identified (maximum 3 marks) |

**Correct Answer (3 marks):**

**Error 1:** Activity A (Market Research) is shown with duration of 5 days but should be 8 days according to the activity data table.

**Error 2:** Activity B (Concept Design) is shown with duration of 6 days but should be 5 days according to the activity data table.

**Error 3:** There is a gap between Activity B finishing (Day 11) and Activity C starting (Day 11). Activity C should start immediately on Day 12 (the day after B finishes on Day 11), as it depends on B being complete.

**Analysis of Errors:**

```
What Chart Shows vs What It Should Show:

Activity A:
WRONG: Days 1-5 (5 days duration)
RIGHT: Days 1-8 (8 days duration)

Activity B:
WRONG: Days 6-11 (6 days duration)  
RIGHT: Days 9-13 (5 days duration, starting Day 9 after A finishes Day 8)

Activity C:
WRONG: Starts Day 11 (while B is still running)
RIGHT: Should start Day 14 (after B finishes Day 13)

Activity D:
Position is actually correct given when C finishes in the error chart,
but would need to move if C is corrected

Activity E:
Position depends on D, so also affected by earlier errors
```

**Additional Possible Errors:**

- Activity B starts on Day 6 but Activity A doesn't finish until Day 8 (should be), so there's scheduling conflict
- Activities B and A overlap on Days 6-8, but B should start after A finishes (sequential dependency not shown correctly)

**Common Student Errors:**
- Identifying consequences of errors rather than root errors
- Not being specific about what the error is (e.g., "Activity A is wrong" insufficient)
- Confusing days with weeks
- Not referencing the activity data table

### Question 14 — 4 marks (June 2024 — 3(b)(i))

**Question:** Using the network diagram, calculate the Earliest Start Time (EST) and Latest Finish Time (LFT) for Activity G.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | Correct method demonstrated for calculating EST |
| 1 mark | Correct EST value for Activity G |
| 1 mark | Correct method demonstrated for calculating LFT |

Critical Path: Start -> B -> E -> G -> H = 22 days
```

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Part (a): Calculate EST for Activity G**

**Method: Forward Pass**

```
Step 1: Identify ALL predecessors of Activity G
- Activity D (via path: Start -> A -> D -> G)
- Activity E (via path: Start -> B -> E -> G)

Step 2: Calculate when each predecessor finishes
Path via A -> D:
- Start = Day 0
- A finishes: Day 0 + 3 = Day 3
- D finishes: Day 3 + 6 = Day 9

Path via B -> E:
- Start = Day 0
- B finishes: Day 0 + 5 = Day 5
- E finishes: Day 5 + 7 = Day 12

Step 3: EST of G = MAXIMUM finish time of all predecessors
- D finishes: Day 9
- E finishes: Day 12
- EST of G = MAX(9, 12) = Day 12
```

**Answer:** EST of Activity G = **Day 12** ✓✓

**Part (b): Calculate LFT for Activity G**

**Method: Backward Pass**

```
Step 1: Calculate project completion time
Critical path = 22 days
Therefore, project finishes on Day 22

Step 2: Calculate LFT for Activity H
- Project finish: Day 22
- H duration: 4 days
- Therefore H must start by: Day 22 - 4 = Day 18
- LFT of H = Day 22

Step 3: Work backwards to find LFT of G
- H must start by Day 18
- G feeds into H
- G duration = 6 days
- Therefore G must finish by: Day 18
- LFT of G = Day 18
```

**Answer:** LFT of Activity G = **Day 18** ✓✓

**Model Answer (4 marks):**

**EST Calculation (2 marks):**

*Activity G has two predecessors: D and E.*
*Path via A→D: Start(0) + A(3) + D(6) = Day 9*
*Path via B→E: Start(0) + B(5) + E(7) = Day 12* ✓
*EST of G = maximum of predecessor finish times = MAX(9,12) = Day 12* ✓

**LFT Calculation (2 marks):**

*Working backwards from project end (Day 22):*
*Activity H must start by: 22 - 4 = Day 18*
*Activity G feeds into H, so G must finish before H starts* ✓
*LFT of G = Day 18* ✓

**Alternative Working Format:**

```
Forward Pass (EST):
A: EST = 0,  EFT = 0+3 = 3
B: EST = 0,  EFT = 0+5 = 5
D: EST = 3,  EFT = 3+6 = 9
E: EST = 5,  EFT = 5+7 = 12
G: EST = MAX(9,12) = 12 ✓

Backward Pass (LFT):
Project end = 22
H: LFT = 22
G: LFT = 22-4 = 18 ✓
```

**Common Errors:**
- Using EST instead of (EST + Duration) for forward pass
- Taking minimum instead of maximum when multiple predecessors
- Forgetting to work backwards from project end for LFT
- Confusing EST with LFT

**Float Calculation (for reference, not required):**

```
Float for Activity G:
Float = LFT - EST - Duration
Float = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0

Zero float indicates G is on the critical path
```

### Question 15 — 6 marks (January 2023 — 3(b)(i))

**Question:** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) using the PERT formula. O = 4 days, M = 7 days, P = 16 days.

**Mark Scheme:**

| Marks | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 mark | PERT formula correctly stated or implied |
| 2 marks | 4M correctly calculated (showing 4×7=28) |
| 2 marks | Correct substitution and addition in numerator |
| 1 mark | Correct final answer with division |

**PERT Formula:**

```
E = (O + 4M + P) / 6

Where:
E = Estimated expected time
O = Optimistic time (best-case scenario)
M = Most likely time (realistic estimate)
P = Pessimistic time (worst-case scenario)
```

**Full Working (6 marks):**

```
Given:
O = 4 days
M = 7 days
P = 16 days

Step 1: State formula
E = (O + 4M + P) / 6  ✓

Step 2: Calculate 4M
4M = 4 × 7 = 28  ✓✓

Step 3: Substitute values into numerator
E = (4 + 28 + 16) / 6  ✓

Step 4: Add numerator
E = 48 / 6  ✓

Step 5: Divide to get final answer
E = 8 days  ✓
```

**Model Answer (6 marks):**

*Using the PERT formula: E = (O + 4M + P) / 6*  ✓

*E = (4 + 4×7 + 16) / 6*  ✓✓

*E = (4 + 28 + 16) / 6*  ✓

*E = 48 / 6*  ✓

*E = 8 days*  ✓

**Alternative Layout:**

```
E = (O + 4M + P) ÷ 6
E = [4 + 4(7) + 16] ÷ 6
E = [4 + 28 + 16] ÷ 6
E = 48 ÷ 6
E = 8 days
```

**Interpretation:**

*The expected time for Activity D is 8 days. This accounts for uncertainty by weighting the most likely estimate (7 days) more heavily than the optimistic (4 days) or pessimistic (16 days) scenarios.*

**Common Errors and Mark Deductions:**

| Error | Mark Deduction | Explanation |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Using M instead of 4M | Lose 2 marks | Most common error; results in E = 6.5 |
| Dividing each term by 6 separately | Lose 2-3 marks | Wrong application of order of operations |
| Arithmetic errors | Lose 1 mark | Correct method but wrong calculation |
| Not showing working | Lose up to 5 marks | Cannot award method marks |
| Missing formula | Lose 1 mark | Must show formula explicitly or implicitly |

**Checking Your Answer:**

The expected time should be:
- Greater than optimistic time (E > O): 8 > 4 ✓
- Less than pessimistic time (E < P): 8 < 16 ✓  
- Close to most likely time: 8 is close to 7 ✓

If your answer doesn't meet these criteria, check your working.

**Model Answer — Level 3 (5-6 marks):**

*PERT is highly useful for complex engineering projects because it accounts for uncertainty through three time estimates (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic), which is realistic given that complex projects often face unpredictable challenges such as technical difficulties, supplier delays, or regulatory changes. The weighted formula (E = (O + 4M + P) / 6) provides more accurate duration estimates than single-point estimates, as it considers the range of possible outcomes while emphasising the most likely scenario through the 4M weighting. This helps project managers identify activities with high uncertainty (large gap between O and P) and focus risk management efforts appropriately.*

*However, PERT has significant limitations that reduce its usefulness in some contexts. It requires three separate estimates for every activity, which is time-consuming and may be difficult when stakeholders lack experience with similar activities or when dealing with novel technologies where even experts cannot provide reliable estimates. The estimates are also subjective, particularly for optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, meaning the accuracy depends entirely on the quality of expert judgement. Furthermore, PERT assumes activity durations are independent, but in complex projects the duration of one activity often affects another (e.g., if procurement is delayed, all dependent activities shift).*

*Overall, PERT is most useful for complex projects where uncertainty is high, the consequences of poor time estimation are severe (e.g., regulatory deadlines, integration with other projects), and stakeholders have sufficient expertise to provide meaningful estimates. However, for simpler projects or those with tight resource constraints, the overhead of gathering three estimates may outweigh the benefit of improved accuracy. The technique is also less useful when dealing with entirely novel activities where even experts cannot distinguish meaningfully between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.*

**Level 2 Answer (3-4 marks):**

*PERT is useful because it accounts for uncertainty by using three time estimates instead of just one. This makes it more accurate for complex projects. It also helps identify where the most risk is by showing which activities have the biggest difference between optimistic and pessimistic times.*

*However, PERT takes a long time to do because you need three estimates for every activity, and these estimates might not be very accurate if people don't have experience.*

**Level 1 Answer (1-2 marks):**

*PERT is useful because it's more accurate. It uses three estimates. But it takes longer to do than other methods.*

**Assessment Criteria for Level 3:**

Must include:
- ✓ Discussion of BOTH advantages AND limitations
- ✓ Specific reference to "complex engineering projects"
- ✓ Justified conclusion about when/where PERT is most appropriate
- ✓ Evidence of understanding beyond basic recall

**Examiner Guidance:**

Award Level 3 (5-6 marks) when response:
- Provides balanced argument with developed points on both sides
- Links PERT characteristics to project complexity/uncertainty
- Reaches a conclusion that synthesizes the arguments
- Uses technical terminology accurately
- Shows evidence of critical thinking

**Model Answer (6 marks):**

*One factor is cost. Focus groups require facilitator time, venue hire, participant travel expenses, and refreshments, making them significantly more expensive than questionnaires, which can be distributed electronically at minimal cost. For a project with limited budget like the Hedgerow Tea packaging system, questionnaires would be more cost-effective.* (2 marks)

*A second factor is the depth of information required. Focus groups generate rich qualitative insights through group discussion and allow Casey to probe deeper into unexpected responses or concerns about the new automated system. Questionnaires only collect responses to predetermined questions without the ability to follow up. If Casey needs detailed understanding of why stakeholders feel a certain way about the packaging changes, focus groups would be better.* (2 marks)

*A third factor is sample size needed for valid results. Focus groups typically involve 6-12 participants and are time-consuming to organise, limiting the total number of people who can be consulted. Questionnaires can be distributed to hundreds of stakeholders simultaneously across all Hedgerow Tea locations. If Casey needs broad representation across customer demographics, suppliers, and employees at multiple sites, questionnaires would be more suitable for achieving statistical significance.* (2 marks)

*Focus groups take weeks to arrange (coordinating diaries, booking venues) and conduct, then require extensive analysis of qualitative data. Questionnaires can be distributed instantly and responses can be analysed automatically, potentially providing results within days rather than weeks.*

**Type of Data Needed:**
*If Casey needs quantifiable data to measure improvement (e.g., "% satisfied with new packaging"), questionnaires provide numerical data that can be presented in graphs. Focus groups provide opinions and themes that are harder to quantify but richer in insight.*

**Differentiation:**

**1-mark answer:** "Cost is a factor because focus groups cost more."

**2-mark answer:** "Cost is a factor because focus groups require venue hire, facilitator fees, and participant expenses, making them more expensive than questionnaires which can be sent electronically for minimal cost. For a budget-conscious project, this cost difference would be significant."

    +--------------------------------->
      Site B      Site A       Site C
```

**Justification (2 marks):**
- Shows comparison between discrete categories (sites)
- Easy to see which site uses most water at a glance
- Values can be read from vertical axis
- Clear visual comparison of quantities
- Appropriate for comparing three separate entities

**Option 2: Pie Chart (Acceptable) — Full Credit with Good Justification**

```
Water Consumption - Proportion by Site

          Site B
          24%
           ___
          /   \
Site A   |     |   Site C
 34%     |     |    42%
          \___/

Total: 36,440 litres/day
```

**Justification (2 marks):**
- Shows each site as proportion of total water use
- Immediately visible that Site C accounts for largest share
- Useful for showing relative percentages
- Helps identify priority site for reduction measures

**Model Answer — Bar Chart (3 marks):**

*A bar chart (or column chart) would be the most appropriate format.* (1 mark) *This allows easy visual comparison between the three sites by displaying them as separate bars whose heights represent water consumption. Charlie can immediately see that Site C uses the most water (15,230 litres/day), followed by Site A (12,450 litres/day), then Site B (8,760 litres/day). Bar charts are specifically designed for comparing discrete categories, which matches the requirement to show which site uses the most water and should be prioritised for water reduction measures.* (2 marks)

**Model Answer — Pie Chart (3 marks):**

*A pie chart would be appropriate for this data.* (1 mark) *It would show each site's water consumption as a proportion of the total usage (36,440 litres/day), with Site C representing 42%, Site A 34%, and Site B 24%. This format immediately highlights that Site C accounts for the largest share of water consumption and should be the priority target for reduction measures. The visual representation makes it easy for the sponsor to see the relative contribution of each site at a glance.* (2 marks)

**Unacceptable Formats (0 marks):**

- **Line graph:** Implies continuous data or trend over time (not comparing categories)
- **Scatter diagram:** Needs two variables to correlate (only one variable here)
- **Histogram:** For frequency distribution within intervals (not categorical comparison)
- **Frequency polygon:** For showing distribution of continuous data

**Common Errors:**

- Naming format without justification (max 1 mark)
- Justification not linked to purpose ("show which site uses most")
- Suggesting multiple formats without choosing one
- Incorrect format selection (line graph, scatter)

**Teaching Point:**

Students should ask: "What am I comparing?"
- Comparing categories → Bar chart or pie chart
- Showing trend over time → Line graph
- Showing correlation between two variables → Scatter diagram
- Showing frequency distribution → Histogram or frequency polygon

### Question 20 — 4 marks (January 2025 — 3(b)(i))

**Question:** (i) Describe how data should be collated and presented. (ii) Explain interpretation to communicate to sponsor.

**Data Table:**

```
Manufacturing Efficiency Project - Performance Data

+------+--------------------------+------------------+
| Week | Production Output (units)| Defect Rate (%)  |
+------+--------------------------+------------------+
|  1   |          2,400           |       3.2        |
|  2   |          2,550           |       2.8        |
|  3   |          2,680           |       2.1        |
|  4   |          2,720           |       1.9        |
+------+--------------------------+------------------+

Change from Week 1 to Week 4:
Output: +320 units (+13.3%)
Defects: -1.3 percentage points (-40.6% relative decrease)
```

**Mark Scheme:**

| Component | Marks | Criteria |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Part (i) — Collation and presentation | 2 marks | 1 mark for appropriate format + 1 mark for explanation |
| Part (ii) — Interpretation | 2 marks | Correct identification of both trends with link to objectives |

**Part (i) — Model Answer (2 marks):**

*The data should be presented using a dual-axis line graph with weeks on the horizontal axis.* (1 mark) *The left vertical axis should show production output (units) with an upward-trending line, and the right vertical axis should show defect rate (percentage) with a downward-trending line. This format clearly demonstrates both objectives being achieved simultaneously - increasing output while decreasing defects - and shows the positive correlation between efficiency improvements and quality improvements over the four-week period.* (1 mark)

**Visual Representation:**

x----x  Defect Rate (%) - RIGHT axis
```

**Acceptable Alternative Answers (2 marks):**

*The data could be presented as two separate line graphs positioned side by side, both using weeks as the horizontal axis. One graph would show production output trending upward from 2,400 to 2,720 units, while the other shows defect rate trending downward from 3.2% to 1.9%. This allows clear comparison of both metrics achieving their improvement targets.*

*Alternatively, a table with calculated changes could be presented alongside the graphs, showing: Output increase of 320 units (+13.3%) and defect rate decrease of 1.3 percentage points (-40.6% relative). This quantifies the improvements for the sponsor.*

**Part (ii) — Model Answer (2 marks):**

*Sarah should communicate that the project is successfully achieving both objectives simultaneously.* (1 mark) *Production output has increased by 13.3% from 2,400 to 2,720 units over the four-week period, while the defect rate has decreased by 40.6% from 3.2% to 1.9%. This demonstrates that improved efficiency has not compromised quality; in fact, both metrics have improved together, suggesting the project interventions (process improvements, staff training, quality controls) are highly effective and delivering better outcomes than originally targeted.* (1 mark)

**Key Points for Part (ii):**

**Trend Identification:**
```
+-------------------+------------+------------------------+
| Metric            | Trend      | Quantification         |
+-------------------+------------+------------------------+
| Production Output | Increasing | Week 1: 2,400 units    |
|                   |            | Week 4: 2,720 units    |
|                   |            | Change: +320 (+13.3%)  |
+-------------------+------------+------------------------+
| Defect Rate       | Decreasing | Week 1: 3.2%           |
|                   |            | Week 4: 1.9%           |
|                   |            | Change: -1.3pp (-40.6%)|
+-------------------+------------+------------------------+
| Overall           | Positive   | Both objectives met    |
|                   | correlation| Quality AND quantity   |
|                   |            | improving together     |
+-------------------+------------+------------------------+
```

**What Sarah Should Emphasize:**

1. **Dual success:** Both objectives achieved (not a trade-off)
2. **Magnitude:** Significant improvements (13% output, 41% defect reduction)
3. **Trend strength:** Consistent improvement week-on-week
4. **Sustainability:** No signs of quality degradation despite higher output
5. **Business impact:** More units produced with fewer defective products = higher profitability

**Common Errors:**

- **Part (i):** Describing what the data is, not how to present it
- **Part (ii):** Stating data points without interpretation/significance
- Not linking trends back to project objectives
- Failing to quantify the improvements
- Missing the "both objectives achieved simultaneously" point

**Differentiation:**

**1-mark answer (Part ii):** "Output went up and defects went down."

**2-mark answer (Part ii):** "The project is achieving both objectives because production increased by 13.3% while defects decreased by 40.6%, showing that higher efficiency does not compromise quality and in fact improves it."

## General Examination Technique Guidance

### Command Words Masterclass

**Understanding what the question is asking for:**

```
+------------+-------------------------+------------------+-----------+
| Command    | What to Do              | Example Response | Marks     |
+------------+-------------------------+------------------+-----------+
| IDENTIFY   | Name/list items         | "Gantt chart"    | 1-2       |
| STATE      | No explanation needed   |                  |           |

+------------+-------------------------+------------------+-----------+
```

### Response Structure by Question Type

**For 1-2 Mark Questions (Identify/State):**
```
❌ WRONG: "Gantt charts are useful project management tools that show..."
✓ RIGHT: "Gantt chart"

Keep it minimal. No elaboration needed.
```

**For 3-6 Mark Questions (Explain/Describe):**
```
Structure: POINT → REASON → EXAMPLE

Example:
POINT: "Time controls prevent schedule overruns"
REASON: "because they enable early identification of delays"
EXAMPLE: "such as when material delivery is later than planned"
```

**For Calculation Questions:**
```
1. State formula
2. Show substitution
3. Show each step
4. Box final answer
5. Include units

Even if you get wrong answer, you can get method marks
```

**For 6-12 Mark Evaluation Questions:**
```
Paragraph 1: Introduction - state what you're evaluating
Paragraph 2: Advantages (2-3 points with examples)
Paragraph 3: Limitations (2-3 points with examples)
Paragraph 4: Balanced conclusion - when is it useful/not useful

Must show BOTH sides for top marks
```

### Time Management Strategy

```
TOTAL TIME: 30 minutes for this workshop
TOTAL MARKS: 80 marks
TIME PER MARK: Approximately 1.5 minutes

+----------------+--------+-------------+
| Question Type  | Marks  | Time Limit  |
+----------------+--------+-------------+
| 1-2 mark Qs    | 2      | 3 minutes   |
| 3-4 mark Qs    | 4      | 6 minutes   |
| 6 mark Qs      | 6      | 9 minutes   |
+----------------+--------+-------------+

STRATEGY:
1. Do easy questions first (build confidence)
2. Don't get stuck - move on and return later
3. Show all working for calculations
4. Leave 2 minutes to review answers
```

### Common Errors to Avoid

**1. Reading Errors:**
- Misreading "advantages" as "disadvantages"
- Missing "NOT" in questions
- Confusing similar terms (EST vs LFT, O vs P)

**2. Response Errors:**
- Generic answers when context is required
- Listing when explanation is needed
- Repeating the question back

**3. Calculation Errors:**
- Not showing working
- Arithmetic mistakes
- Using wrong formula
- Missing units

**4. Time Errors:**
- Spending 15 minutes on a 2-mark question
- Running out of time on high-mark questions
- Not attempting all questions

### Mark Optimisation Strategies

**How to Gain Extra Marks:**

1. **Use scenario context:** "Charlie needs negotiation skills because Sara controls the £45,000 budget" scores higher than "to get approval"

2. **Quantify when possible:** "13.3% increase" scores higher than "went up"

3. **Use technical terms correctly:** "EST" not "earliest time"

4. **Show working:** Even wrong answers get method marks

5. **Be specific:** "Activity B duration is 6 days but should be 5" not "Activity B is wrong"

**How to Lose Marks:**

1. Not answering the question asked
2. Repetition (saying same thing different ways)
3. Waffle without substance
4. Missing command word requirements
5. Poor presentation (illegible writing)

## Marking Principles for Lecturers

### Mark Scheme Application

**Credit Valid Alternatives:**
- Accept any response that meets the assessment criteria
- Don't penalize for different examples if principle is correct
- Technical terminology may vary (accept valid alternatives)

**Context Weighting:**
- Some questions explicitly award higher marks for contextual responses
- Generic correct answers receive partial credit where marked
- Scenario-specific application demonstrates higher-level understanding

**Quality Over Quantity:**
- Three well-explained points > six superficial points
- Depth of understanding > breadth of coverage
- Repetition in different words ≠ additional marks

**Professional Judgement:**
- Accept responses demonstrating sound PM thinking
- Credit industry-standard terminology and frameworks
- Value real-world engineering examples

### Differentiation by Level

**Pass Level (40-54%):**
```
Characteristics:
- Demonstrates basic understanding
- Can recall definitions and simple processes
- Applies knowledge in familiar contexts
- May lack depth or miss nuances

Example:
"SMART objectives are important for project planning."
(Identification without development)
```

**Merit Level (55-69%):**
```
Characteristics:
- Shows secure understanding across topics
- Applies knowledge accurately in varied contexts
- Provides detailed explanations with development
- Makes connections between concepts

Example:
"SMART objectives are important because they provide measurable
targets (M) within specific timeframes (T), enabling project
managers to monitor progress objectively and identify when
interventions are needed."
(Understanding with development and application)
```

**Distinction Level (70-100%):**
```
Characteristics:
- Comprehensive, detailed understanding
- Applies and synthesizes knowledge in novel contexts
- Provides evaluative analysis with justified conclusions
- Uses technical terminology accurately throughout
- Integrates concepts from multiple LOs

Example:
"SMART objectives are critical for project success because they
translate strategic intent into measurable deliverables. The
Measurable criterion enables variance analysis (comparing actual
vs planned performance), while Time-specific deadlines create
accountability and enable critical path scheduling. However,
overly rigid objectives can constrain adaptive response when
project conditions change, requiring balanced application of
SMART criteria with appropriate change control processes."
(Synthesis, evaluation, and critical thinking)
```

## Summary: Topic Prioritisation for Revision

Based on typical mark allocation and examination frequency:

### HIGH PRIORITY Topics
**Master these first - highest exam frequency and marks**

```
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------+
