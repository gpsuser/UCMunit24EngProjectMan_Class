## 1. Session Objectives

> **Time: 3 minutes | All Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Recall the key knowledge, concepts, and techniques covered in Weeks 1–20 of this unit.
- Identify the learning outcomes and assessment criteria that are examined in the mid-course assessment.
- Apply effective examination technique to maximise marks in structured response questions.
- Demonstrate understanding of the command words used in examination questions (identify, describe, explain, analyse, evaluate).

> **Lecturer note:** Distribute a one-page revision summary sheet at the start of the session if prepared. Emphasise that this lecture is consolidation — it is not introducing new material. The goal is to make connections between topics and sharpen recall.

## 2. Introduction: Why This Assessment Matters

> **Time: 4 minutes | All Learning Outcomes**

Week 21 marks the midpoint of this course. The mid-course assessment tests the knowledge and skills developed across Phases 1 to 4 of the delivery programme — covering the stages of an engineering project, the people who manage them, the tools used to plan them, and the information that drives decision-making.

The Cambridge TECHNICALS Unit 24 examination is a **2-hour, 80-mark written paper** divided into four questions. Each question draws on a detailed engineering scenario, requiring learners to apply their knowledge in a practical context rather than simply recalling definitions. This is a critical distinction: the examination rewards application, analysis, and evaluation — not just factual recall.

As Axelos (2017, p. 4) notes in the context of professional project management, understanding how principles connect to real-world practice is the hallmark of effective performance. The examination is designed with precisely this philosophy in mind.

**The four examination question areas that relate to Weeks 1–20 content are:**

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Q1: Project context, stakeholder analysis, roles & skills   |
| Q2: Project planning tools (Gantt, CPA, PERT)               |
| Q3: Project resources, problem-solving, financial planning  |
| Q4: Information types, sources, data presentation          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 3. Assessment Structure and Examination Format

> **Time: 5 minutes | All Learning Outcomes**

### 3.1 Paper Structure

The Unit 24 examination is structured as follows (OCR, 2022):

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Duration | 2 hours |
| Total marks | 80 |
| Number of questions | 4 (all compulsory) |
| Question format | Scenario-based, structured sub-questions |
| Mark distribution | Approximately 17–22 marks per question |

### 3.2 Learning Outcome Weighting

The OCR unit specification prescribes minimum and maximum weightings for each learning outcome across the examination paper (OCR, 2023):

| Learning Outcome | Specification Weighting | Key Focus Areas |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| LO1 – Project Stages | 10–30% | Initiation, planning, implementation, closure |
| LO2 – People and Roles | 10–30% | Roles, leadership, communication, skills |
| LO3 – PM Tools | 7–23% | Gantt charts, CPA, PERT |
| LO4 – Information Management | 10–30% | Types, sources, validity, data collation |
| LO5 – Monitoring | 10–30% | Internal and external factors *(covered in Phase 5)* |
| LO6 – Measuring Success | 7–23% | Feedback types and methods *(covered in Phase 6)* |

> **Key point:** The mid-course assessment draws primarily from **LO1, LO2, LO3, and LO4** — the content covered in Weeks 1–20. Note, however, that OCR past papers routinely include questions on LO5 and LO6 within the same paper, so breadth of understanding remains important.

### 3.3 Command Words — What They Demand

Understanding command words is one of the most impactful examination techniques a learner can develop:

| Command Word | What is Required | Typical Marks |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Identify / State** | Name or list — no explanation required | 1–2 |
| **Describe** | Give characteristics or features | 2–4 |
| **Explain** | Give reasons, causes, or how something works | 3–6 |
| **Analyse** | Break down in detail, showing how parts relate | 6–9 |
| **Evaluate / Justify** | Make a judgement with evidence and context | 9–12 |

> **Lecturer note:** Use a brief class exercise here — project one sub-question on screen and ask learners to identify the command word and decide what level of response is required. This takes approximately 2 minutes.

## 4. Consolidation: LO1 — Project Stages

> **Time: 12 minutes | LO1.1, LO1.2, LO1.3, LO1.4**

### 4.1 The Four Stages of a Project

Every engineering project, regardless of scale, passes through four sequential stages (Meredith and Mantel, 2012, p. 18). These were introduced in Weeks 1–5:

```
+---------------+     +-----------------+     +--------------------+     +---------------+
|  INITIATION   | --> |    PLANNING     | --> | IMPLEMENTATION     | --> |    CLOSURE    |
|               |     |                 |     |                    |     |               |
| - Project     |     | - SMART         |     | - Execution        |     | - Final       |
|   proposal    |     |   objectives    |     | - Monitoring       |     |   acceptance  |
| - Feasibility |     | - Resource plan |     | - Controlling      |     | - Final report|
|   study       |     | - Risk analysis |     | - Change control   |     | - Lessons     |
| - Stakeholder |     | - Financial plan|     | - Communication    |     |   learned     |
|   analysis    |     | - Project       |     |                    |     |               |
|               |     |   schedule      |     |                    |     |               |
+---------------+     +-----------------+     +--------------------+     +---------------+
```

### 4.2 Project Controls: Time, Cost, and Quality

A central concept within LO1 is the **project control triangle** (also known as the Iron Triangle or triple constraint). Burke (2013, p. 23) describes this as the three fundamental levers available to a project manager:

```
           QUALITY
             /\
            /  \
           /    \
          /      \
         /        \
        /          \
       /____________\
     TIME          COST
```

- **Time** — meeting deadlines and milestones
- **Cost** — managing expenditure against budget
- **Quality** — ensuring outputs meet specified standards

In examination questions, learners are frequently asked to justify which control is most critical for a given engineering scenario. The answer must always be contextualised to the scenario, not stated as a general preference.

### 4.3 Stakeholder Analysis

Stakeholder analysis (covered in Week 4) is assessed with high frequency. The **power-interest matrix** (Mendelow, 1991, cited in Johnson et al., 2017, p. 107) maps stakeholders according to their level of power and interest:

```
         HIGH POWER
              |
 KEEP         |        MANAGE
 SATISFIED    |        CLOSELY
              |
--------------+--------------
              |
 MONITOR      |        KEEP
 (minimum     |        INFORMED
  effort)     |
              |
         LOW POWER
    LOW INTEREST    HIGH INTEREST
```

**Management strategies by quadrant:**

| Quadrant | Power | Interest | Strategy |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| Manage Closely | High | High | Active engagement, regular consultation |
| Keep Satisfied | High | Low | Regular updates, manage expectations |
| Keep Informed | Low | High | Provide information, involve in decisions where appropriate |
| Monitor | Low | Low | Minimal effort, periodic review |

### 4.4 Sources of Finance (Financial Planning)

Financial planning (LO1.2) frequently appears in examination questions. Key source categories include:

- **Internal sources:** retained profits, asset disposal, working capital reduction
- **External sources — equity:** issuing shares, venture capital, angel investment
- **External sources — debt:** bank loans, debentures, overdraft facilities
- **Grants:** government or institutional funding, typically for public benefit projects

For each source, learners should be prepared to state one advantage and one disadvantage, linked to the context of the specific project scenario.

> **Example:** Equity finance gives access to large capital without repayment obligations, but shareholders gain a stake in the business and may influence decision-making (Watson and Head, 2016, p. 214).

## 5. Consolidation: LO2 — People and Skills

> **Time: 10 minutes | LO2.1, LO2.2**

### 5.1 Project Management Roles (LO2.1)

Week 6 introduced the key roles within a project management structure (APM, 2019, p. 33):

| Role | Primary Responsibility |
|------|----------------------|
| **Project Sponsor** | Provides authority and funding; business case ownership |
| **Project Manager** | Day-to-day management; planning, monitoring, decision-making |
| **Project Board** | Strategic oversight; major decisions and governance |
| **Team Members** | Deliver specific workstreams and tasks |
| **End Users** | Define requirements; receive and use the final deliverable |
| **Contractors / Consultants** | Provide specialist services or expertise |

### 5.2 Leadership Styles (LO2.2)

Leadership styles (Week 7) are frequently examined. The four principal styles are (Hersey and Blanchard, 1977, cited in Northouse, 2018, p. 99):

```
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| LEADERSHIP STYLE     | CHARACTERISTICS                                  |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Directive            | High task, low relationship; clear instructions  |
|                      | and close supervision                            |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Supportive           | Low task, high relationship; empathy and         |
|                      | encouragement; collaborative environment         |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Collaborative        | Shared decision-making; team participation in    |
|                      | problem-solving and planning                     |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Responsive           | Adapts style to situation and team readiness;    |
|                      | flexible and context-dependent                   |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
```

In examination questions, learners must not simply identify a style — they must **describe its characteristics** and, at higher mark tariffs, explain when and why it would be appropriate for a given project scenario.

### 5.3 Essential Project Management Skills (LO2.2)

Week 8 covered the core skills a project manager must demonstrate. These skills are assessed through scenario-based questions that ask learners to explain how a specific skill benefits a named project:

- **Planning skills** — breaking projects into tasks, setting milestones, resource allocation
- **Time management** — prioritising tasks, meeting deadlines, managing competing demands
- **Communication skills** — formal and informal communication; reporting; stakeholder briefings
- **Information management** — recording, storing, retrieving, and acting on data
- **Decision-making** — critical thinking, problem-solving, risk assessment
- **Risk mitigation** — identifying threats and developing contingency responses

> **Examination tip:** When asked how a skill benefits a project, always use the following structure: **Name the skill → Explain how it operates → Link it to a specific benefit for the project in the scenario.** This mirrors the mark scheme's requirements for explanation-level responses.

### 5.4 Team Development: Tuckman's Model (LO2.2)

Tuckman (1965) identified four stages of team development, covered in Week 9, which are relevant to questions about managing teams in engineering projects:

```
FORMING --> STORMING --> NORMING --> PERFORMING
  |              |            |            |
Anxiety,     Conflict,    Cohesion,   High output,
uncertainty  competing    agreement,  shared goals,
             ideas        trust       effective
```

A fifth stage — **Adjourning** — describes the project team disbanding at closure (Tuckman and Jensen, 1977, p. 419).

## 6. Consolidation: LO3 — Project Management Tools

> **Time: 13 minutes | LO3.1, LO3.2, LO3.3**

This section covers the three core planning tools assessed in Weeks 11–15. Collectively, these questions often represent the highest mark allocation on the examination paper.

### 6.1 Gantt Charts (LO3.1)

A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart that represents the planned schedule for a project's activities against a timeline. It was developed by Henry Gantt in the early 20th century and remains one of the most widely used project planning tools (Lock, 2014, p. 102).

**Key features of a Gantt chart:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Activities | Listed vertically on the left-hand axis |
| Timeline | Shown horizontally (days, weeks, months) |
| Bars | Length represents duration of each activity |
| Dependencies | Activities that must follow others |
| Milestones | Key decision or review points, often marked as diamonds |

**Advantages and limitations:**

```
ADVANTAGES                          LIMITATIONS
- Simple to read and understand     - Does not show resource loading
- Shows sequence and duration       - Does not explicitly show dependencies
- Identifies parallel activities    - Can become complex on large projects
- Effective communication tool      - Does not calculate float time
```

### 6.2 Critical Path Analysis (LO3.2)

Critical Path Analysis (CPA) is a network-based planning technique that identifies the **longest sequence of dependent activities** in a project — the critical path — and thus determines the **minimum project completion time** (Lockyer and Gordon, 1996, p. 78).

**Key terminology:**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Activity** | A task with a defined duration |
| **Node** | A circle representing the start or end of an activity |
| **EST** | Earliest Start Time — earliest an activity can begin |
| **LFT** | Latest Finish Time — latest an activity can finish without delaying the project |
| **Float Time** | LFT − EST − Duration; available delay without impact on project completion |
| **Critical Path** | Activities with zero float; any delay delays the project |

**Node structure:**

```
         +-------+-------+
         |  EST  |  LFT  |
         +-------+-------+
         |   Activity No |
         +---------------+
```

**Float calculation:**

```
Float = LFT - EST - Duration
Critical path activities have Float = 0
```

> **Worked example:**
> Activity D has EST = 10, LFT = 18, Duration = 6
> Float = 18 − 10 − 6 = 2 days
> This activity is NOT on the critical path.

**Advantages of CPA for engineering projects:**

- Identifies which activities must not be delayed (critical path)
- Enables resource reallocation from activities with float to critical activities
- Facilitates contingency planning
- Supports clear communication of project timeline to stakeholders
- Provides a basis for monitoring actual versus planned progress

**Limitations:**

- Assumes activity durations are known with certainty
- Does not account for resource constraints
- Requires expert knowledge to construct accurately

### 6.3 PERT (Programme Evaluation and Review Technique) (LO3.3)

PERT was developed in the 1950s for the US Navy's Polaris submarine missile programme (Lock, 2014, p. 123). Unlike CPA, PERT explicitly acknowledges **uncertainty in activity durations** by using three time estimates:

| Estimate | Symbol | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Optimistic time | O | Shortest possible duration (best case) |
| Most likely time | M | The most realistic expected duration |
| Pessimistic time | P | Longest possible duration (worst case) |

**PERT Formula for Expected Duration (E):**

```
         O + 4M + P
    E = ____________

               6
```

> **Worked example (from January 2022 examination):**
> O = 20 months, M = 27 months, P = 40 months
>
>         20 + (4 × 27) + 40     20 + 108 + 40     168
>    E = ___________________  = ______________ = _____ = 28 months
>                 6                    6              6
>
> The expected project duration = **28 months**

**PERT versus CPA — key comparison:**

| Feature | CPA | PERT |
|---------|-----|------|
| Duration assumption | Deterministic (one fixed value) | Probabilistic (three estimates) |
| Best used when | Durations are well-known | High uncertainty or novel projects |
| Output | Critical path and float times | Expected duration with statistical range |
| Calculation complexity | Moderate | Slightly higher |

## 7. Consolidation: LO4 — Information Management

> **Time: 8 minutes | LO4.1, LO4.2, LO4.3, LO4.4, LO4.5**

### 7.1 Types of Information (LO4.1)

Two fundamental distinctions apply to all information used in project management (Wisniewski, 2016, p. 5):

| Classification | Definition | Examples in Engineering Projects |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Quantitative** | Numerical data that can be measured | Test failure rates, costs, durations, dimensions |
| **Qualitative** | Descriptive data based on judgement or opinion | Customer satisfaction comments, team morale assessments |

Within quantitative data, the following statistical measures are relevant:

- **Mean** — the arithmetic average
- **Median** — the middle value in an ordered dataset
- **Mode** — the most frequently occurring value
- **Range** — the difference between highest and lowest values
- **Skewness** — the asymmetry of a distribution

> **Negative skew** means the data is clustered towards higher values with a long tail to the left. **Positive skew** means the data is clustered towards lower values with a long tail to the right.

### 7.2 Sources of Information (LO4.2)

| Source | Definition | Examples |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Internal** | Originates within the organisation | Project reports, staff surveys, financial records |
| **External** | Originates outside the organisation | Market research, government statistics, supplier data |
| **Primary** | Collected first-hand for a specific purpose | Experiments, direct observations, commissioned surveys |
| **Secondary** | Previously collected for another purpose | Published reports, academic literature, industry statistics |

### 7.3 Information Validity and Reliability (LO4.3)

Week 19 addressed the criteria for evaluating whether information can be trusted. The RAVEN framework is a useful aide-mémoire for assessing source quality (Walton, 2008):

| RAVEN Criterion | Meaning | Examination Application |
|-----------------|---------|------------------------|
| **R** — Reputation | Is the source well-regarded? | Academic journals vs blogs |
| **A** — Ability to observe | Did the source witness the information directly? | Primary vs secondary data |
| **V** — Vested interest | Does the source have a reason to bias the data? | Manufacturer vs independent test |
| **E** — Expertise | Does the source have relevant knowledge? | Qualified engineer vs general public |
| **N** — Neutrality | Is the source impartial? | Trade bodies vs regulatory bodies |

### 7.4 Data Collation and Graphical Presentation (LO4.5)

Week 20 introduced how project data is collated and presented graphically to inform decision-making. Key graphical forms include:

| Format | Best Used For |
|--------|--------------|
| **Bar chart** | Comparing categories |
| **Pie chart** | Showing proportions of a whole |
| **Line graph** | Showing trends over time |
| **Frequency polygon** | Showing distribution of continuous data |
| **Histogram** | Showing frequency distribution by interval |
| **Scatter diagram** | Showing correlation between two variables |

> **Examination note:** Learners may be asked to complete, construct, or interpret a graph from tabulated data. For a frequency polygon, data points are plotted at the midpoint of each class interval and joined with straight lines.

## 8. Examination Technique

> **Time: 5 minutes | All Learning Outcomes**

### 8.1 Reading the Scenario

The Unit 24 examination presents a detailed engineering scenario — typically describing a real-world project context. Every piece of detail in the scenario exists for a reason. Learners should:

1. Read the entire scenario once for overall understanding before reading the questions.
2. Annotate key facts (dates, people, figures, problems) before answering.
3. Look for context clues that indicate which stakeholder, tool, or principle is relevant.

### 8.2 Structuring Responses

For the most common response formats:

**Identify / State (1–2 marks):**
> Write a concise, accurate answer. No elaboration required.

**Describe / Explain (3–6 marks):**
> Use the following structure: **Point → Reason → Example from scenario**

**Analyse / Evaluate (7–12 marks):**
> Structure a developed argument:
> - State a claim
> - Explain in detail why it is true
> - Link to the scenario with a specific example
> - Consider an opposing view or limitation
> - Reach a justified conclusion

### 8.3 Time Management in the Examination

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Total time:  120 minutes                            |
| Total marks: 80 marks                               |
| Approx time per mark: 1.5 minutes                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Recommended approach:                               |
|  - 5 min: Read scenario and plan                    |
|  - 25 min per question (4 questions)                |
|  - 5 min: Review and check answers                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

### 8.4 Common Errors to Avoid

- **Generic answers** — failing to reference the scenario context
- **Insufficient development** — stopping at identification when explanation is required
- **Confusing similar terms** — e.g., EST and LFT in CPA, or optimistic and pessimistic in PERT
- **Arithmetic errors in PERT** — always show working to gain method marks
- **Ignoring negative questions** — when asked for a disadvantage, do not write an advantage

## 9. Conclusion

> **Time: 2 minutes | All Learning Outcomes**

This session has consolidated the core content covered in Weeks 1–20, drawing together the four phases of the course: project stages and planning (LO1), people and skills (LO2), project management tools (LO3), and information management (LO4).

The mid-course assessment provides a valuable opportunity to benchmark understanding against examination standards. Learners are encouraged to:

- Review their notes from Weeks 1–20 before the assessment.
- Practise applying command words to structured responses.
- Work through specimen questions under timed conditions.
- Focus particular attention on CPA and PERT — these consistently attract the highest mark allocations in Unit 24 examinations.

Success in engineering project management, both in assessment and in professional practice, depends on the ability to apply structured thinking to complex, ambiguous, real-world problems. The examination is designed to develop and test precisely that ability (PMI, 2021, p. 7).
