## Part B: Task

### Scenario-Based Task: Role Identification and RACI Matrix Creation

**Scenario:**

A medium-sized manufacturing company is undertaking a project to upgrade its quality control system with automated inspection equipment. The project has a budget of £350,000 and a 9-month timeline. The new system will use AI-powered cameras to detect defects in manufactured components, replacing the current manual inspection process.

**Key Information:**
- The Operations Director has authorized the project and secured funding
- The project will affect the Quality Assurance department (10 staff members)
- External suppliers will provide the camera hardware and AI software
- An external consultant with expertise in machine vision will advise on system configuration
- The company's IT department will integrate the system with existing databases
- Production line workers will need to interact with the new system daily

**Your Task:**

1. **Identify the key project roles** (minimum of 8 roles) that would be needed for this project. For each role, briefly state who from the scenario would fill this role (you may need to infer some roles based on the scenario).

2. **Create a RACI matrix** for the following six deliverables:
   - Project initiation document
   - Requirements specification
   - Equipment procurement
   - System installation and configuration
   - Staff training program
   - User acceptance testing

   Use at least 6 different roles in your RACI matrix.

3. **Briefly explain** one potential conflict that might arise between two different stakeholder roles in this project and how clear role definition would help prevent or resolve it.
