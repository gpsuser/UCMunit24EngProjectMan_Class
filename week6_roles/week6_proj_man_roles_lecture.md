## 2. Introduction to Project Management Roles
**Time: 0-10 minutes**

### The Importance of Clear Role Definition

In engineering projects, the delineation of roles and responsibilities is not merely an administrative formality; it is a critical success factor that determines project outcomes (Project Management Institute, 2021). When roles are ambiguous or poorly defined, projects experience communication breakdowns, duplicated efforts, accountability gaps, and decision-making delays (Kerzner, 2017).

The Institute of Engineering and Technology (2019) emphasises that engineering projects, with their technical complexity and multidisciplinary nature, require particularly robust governance structures. A well-defined project management structure provides:

- **Clear accountability:** Each individual knows their specific responsibilities
- **Efficient communication:** Reporting lines and escalation paths are established
- **Effective decision-making:** Authority levels are understood
- **Risk mitigation:** Oversight and control mechanisms are in place
- **Stakeholder satisfaction:** Expectations are managed appropriately

### The Project Management Hierarchy

Engineering projects typically employ a hierarchical structure that ensures appropriate governance whilst maintaining operational efficiency. This structure can be visualised as follows:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │  Project Sponsor    │
                    │  (Strategic Level)  │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               │
                    ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                    │   Project Board/    │
                    │ Steering Committee  │
                    │ (Governance Level)  │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               │
                    ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                    │  Project Manager    │
                    │ (Operational Level) │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               │
           ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
           │                   │                   │
    ┌──────▼──────┐     ┌──────▼──────┐    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │   Team      │     │   Team      │    │   Team      │
    │  Leader 1   │     │  Leader 2   │    │  Leader 3   │
    └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘    └──────┬──────┘
           │                   │                   │
      ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐        ┌────┴────┐
      │ Team    │         │ Team    │        │ Team    │
      │ Members │         │ Members │        │ Members │
      └─────────┘         └─────────┘        └─────────┘
```

This hierarchical arrangement ensures that strategic oversight, tactical governance, and operational execution are appropriately separated whilst maintaining effective communication channels (Association for Project Management, 2019).

## 3. The Project Sponsor
**Time: 10-18 minutes**

### Definition and Purpose

The project sponsor is a senior executive who champions the project within the organisation and provides high-level strategic direction (Turner, 2016). The sponsor serves as the bridge between the project and the organisation's strategic objectives, ensuring that project activities align with broader business goals.

According to the Office of Government Commerce (2009), the sponsor role is critical because it provides the project with organisational legitimacy, secures necessary resources, and maintains executive-level commitment throughout the project lifecycle.

### Key Duties and Responsibilities

The project sponsor's responsibilities encompass both strategic and supportive functions:

**Strategic Responsibilities:**

1. **Define the business case:** The sponsor articulates why the project is necessary and how it aligns with organisational strategy (Cleland and Ireland, 2016). For engineering projects, this includes justifying capital expenditure, demonstrating return on investment, and identifying strategic benefits such as improved manufacturing efficiency or enhanced product capabilities.

2. **Secure funding and resources:** The sponsor obtains executive approval for budget allocation and ensures that adequate resources (financial, human, technological) are available (Kerzner, 2017). In engineering contexts, this may involve securing capital for equipment purchases, facility modifications, or research and development activities.

3. **Set project scope and objectives:** Working with the project board, the sponsor establishes high-level objectives and defines what the project will and will not deliver (Project Management Institute, 2021).

**Supportive Responsibilities:**

1. **Champion the project:** The sponsor advocates for the project within the organisation, maintaining senior management commitment and removing organisational barriers (Turner, 2016).

2. **Provide strategic guidance:** The sponsor offers direction on major decisions, particularly those affecting scope, budget, or strategic alignment (Association for Project Management, 2019).

3. **Resolve escalated issues:** When the project manager encounters obstacles beyond their authority, the sponsor intervenes to resolve them (Kerzner, 2017).

4. **Monitor project progress:** The sponsor reviews high-level reports and ensures the project remains on track to deliver expected benefits (Office of Government Commerce, 2009).

### Example: Project Sponsor in Engineering

Consider a manufacturing engineering project to implement automated assembly line technology:

- **Business case development:** The sponsor demonstrates how automation will reduce unit costs by 30%, improve quality consistency, and enhance competitive positioning
- **Resource securing:** The sponsor obtains £2.5 million capital approval from the board and secures support from operations, quality, and IT departments
- **Strategic guidance:** When technical challenges arise, the sponsor helps the project manager determine whether to modify specifications or extend timelines
- **Organisational championing:** The sponsor addresses resistance from production staff concerned about job security, communicating the company's commitment to retraining and redeployment

---

## 4. Project Board and Steering Committee
**Time: 18-26 minutes**

### Definition and Purpose

The project board, sometimes called the steering committee, is a governance body that provides oversight, direction, and decision-making authority for the project (Association for Project Management, 2019). The board sits between the sponsor and project manager, ensuring that the project is managed effectively whilst maintaining alignment with organisational objectives.

According to PRINCE2 methodology (Office of Government Commerce, 2009), the project board is responsible for project success and provides unified direction from both business and technical perspectives.

### Composition

The project board typically comprises three key roles:

**1. Executive (Project Sponsor representative):** Provides business perspective and has ultimate authority for project decisions

**2. Senior User Representative:** Represents the interests of those who will use the project outputs or receive the benefits

**3. Senior Supplier Representative:** Represents those providing resources, expertise, or technical solutions

For larger engineering projects, the board may include additional members such as quality assurance representatives, health and safety officers, or technical specialists (Turner, 2016).

### Key Duties and Responsibilities

**Governance and Oversight:**

1. **Approve project plans:** The board reviews and approves detailed project plans, including schedules, budgets, resource allocations, and risk management strategies (Kerzner, 2017).

2. **Monitor project performance:** The board regularly reviews progress against baselines, examining variances in time, cost, quality, and scope (Project Management Institute, 2021).

3. **Make key decisions:** The board has authority to approve or reject change requests, scope modifications, budget adjustments, and major risk mitigation strategies (Association for Project Management, 2019).

**Strategic Direction:**

1. **Ensure business alignment:** The board verifies that project activities continue to support organisational strategy and that expected benefits remain achievable (Office of Government Commerce, 2009).

2. **Resolve conflicts:** When stakeholder interests conflict, the board arbitrates and determines the appropriate course of action (Turner, 2016).

3. **Approve stage gates:** For phased projects, the board reviews deliverables at each stage gate and authorises progression to the next phase (Cleland and Ireland, 2016).

**Support and Communication:**

1. **Remove obstacles:** The board uses its organisational authority to eliminate barriers facing the project team (Kerzner, 2017).

2. **Ensure stakeholder engagement:** The board maintains communication with key stakeholders and manages their expectations (Project Management Institute, 2021).

### Meeting Frequency and Structure

Project boards typically meet at predetermined intervals, commonly monthly or at key project milestones (Association for Project Management, 2019). Meetings follow a structured agenda:

- Project manager's status report
- Review of key performance indicators
- Discussion of risks and issues
- Review of change requests
- Decision-making on escalated matters
- Strategic guidance provision

### Example: Project Board in Engineering

For a product development project creating a new electric vehicle powertrain:

**Board Composition:**
- Executive: Manufacturing Director (sponsor representative)
- Senior User: Sales and Marketing Director (representing customers)
- Senior Supplier: Engineering Director (representing technical resources)
- Additional members: Quality Manager, Supply Chain Manager

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Approved transition from aluminium to composite materials when weight targets couldn't be met (change request approval)
- Authorised additional £500k budget for thermal management system development (budget adjustment)
- Resolved conflict between cost-reduction targets and performance specifications (stakeholder conflict resolution)
- Approved progression from prototype phase to pre-production phase (stage gate decision)

## 5. The Project Team Structure
**Time: 26-41 minutes**

### 5.1 The Project Manager

#### Definition and Purpose

The project manager is the individual with day-to-day responsibility for planning, executing, monitoring, and closing the project (Project Management Institute, 2021). In engineering contexts, project managers must combine technical knowledge with management skills to coordinate complex, multidisciplinary activities (Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2019).

#### Key Duties and Responsibilities

**Planning Responsibilities:**

1. **Develop detailed project plans:** The project manager creates comprehensive work breakdown structures, schedules (using tools such as Gantt charts and critical path analysis), resource allocation plans, and budget breakdowns (Kerzner, 2017).

2. **Risk identification and planning:** The project manager identifies potential risks, assesses their likelihood and impact, and develops mitigation strategies (Association for Project Management, 2019).

3. **Quality planning:** The project manager establishes quality standards, inspection points, and testing protocols appropriate for engineering deliverables (Turner, 2016).

**Execution Responsibilities:**

1. **Team coordination:** The project manager assigns tasks, coordinates activities across different workstreams, and ensures that dependencies are managed effectively (Project Management Institute, 2021).

2. **Resource management:** The project manager allocates and reallocates resources as needed, ensuring optimal utilisation whilst managing constraints (Cleland and Ireland, 2016).

3. **Stakeholder communication:** The project manager maintains regular communication with all stakeholders, providing status updates and managing expectations (Kerzner, 2017).

**Monitoring and Control Responsibilities:**

1. **Progress tracking:** The project manager monitors actual performance against planned baselines for time, cost, quality, and scope (Association for Project Management, 2019).

2. **Variance analysis:** When deviations occur, the project manager analyses causes and implements corrective actions (Office of Government Commerce, 2009).

3. **Change management:** The project manager assesses change requests, determines impacts, and makes recommendations to the project board (Turner, 2016).

4. **Issue resolution:** The project manager addresses problems as they arise, escalating to the board when necessary (Project Management Institute, 2021).

**Closure Responsibilities:**

1. **Deliverable handover:** The project manager ensures that all outputs meet specifications and are properly transferred to operational teams (Kerzner, 2017).

2. **Documentation:** The project manager completes all project documentation, including lessons learned and final reports (Association for Project Management, 2019).

### 5.2 Project Team Leaders

#### Definition and Purpose

Project team leaders, sometimes called workstream leaders or work package managers, are responsible for managing specific components or phases of the project (Turner, 2016). In engineering projects, team leaders often have deep technical expertise in their particular domain.

#### Key Duties and Responsibilities

1. **Workstream planning:** Team leaders develop detailed plans for their specific work packages, including task sequencing, resource requirements, and deliverable specifications (Kerzner, 2017).

2. **Team supervision:** Team leaders directly supervise team members, providing technical guidance, monitoring performance, and addressing day-to-day issues (Project Management Institute, 2021).

3. **Technical problem-solving:** Team leaders apply their specialist knowledge to resolve technical challenges within their domain (Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2019).

4. **Progress reporting:** Team leaders provide regular updates to the project manager on progress, risks, and issues within their workstream (Association for Project Management, 2019).

5. **Quality assurance:** Team leaders ensure that deliverables within their workstream meet required standards and specifications (Office of Government Commerce, 2009).

### 5.3 Project Team Members

#### Definition and Purpose

Project team members are the individuals who carry out the actual project work, producing the deliverables required to achieve project objectives (Project Management Institute, 2021). In engineering projects, team members typically possess specialist technical skills.

#### Key Duties and Responsibilities

1. **Task execution:** Team members complete assigned tasks in accordance with specifications, schedules, and quality standards (Kerzner, 2017).

2. **Technical contribution:** Team members apply their specialist knowledge to design, develop, test, or implement engineering solutions (Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2019).

3. **Collaboration:** Team members work cooperatively with colleagues, sharing information and supporting integrated problem-solving (Turner, 2016).

4. **Progress reporting:** Team members provide updates to their team leader on task completion, time spent, and any obstacles encountered (Association for Project Management, 2019).

5. **Issue identification:** Team members alert their team leader to problems, risks, or opportunities as they arise (Project Management Institute, 2021).

### Example: Complete Team Structure

For a civil engineering project to design and construct a pedestrian bridge:

**Project Manager:** Civil Engineering Project Manager
- Overall project planning and coordination

## 6. End Users and Customers
**Time: 51-61 minutes**

### Definition and Distinction

Whilst the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are important distinctions between end users and customers in project contexts (Project Management Institute, 2021):

**Customer:** The individual or organisation that commissions and pays for the project. The customer defines requirements and accepts final deliverables (Office of Government Commerce, 2009).

**End User:** The individual or group who will actually use the project outputs in day-to-day operations. End users may or may not be the same as the customer (Turner, 2016).

### Why This Distinction Matters

Understanding the difference between customers and end users is crucial for engineering projects because their needs and priorities often differ (Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2019):

- **Customers** typically prioritise cost, schedule, and strategic alignment
- **End users** typically prioritise functionality, usability, and operational efficiency

Failure to address both perspectives can result in projects that satisfy contractual requirements but fail to deliver practical value (Kerzner, 2017).

### Roles and Responsibilities

**Customer Responsibilities:**

1. **Define requirements:** Customers specify what the project must deliver, including performance criteria, constraints, and success measures (Association for Project Management, 2019).

2. **Provide funding:** Customers authorise and provide financial resources for the project (Cleland and Ireland, 2016).

3. **Make decisions:** Customers have authority to approve scope changes, accept deliverables, and determine project success (Project Management Institute, 2021).

4. **Acceptance testing:** Customers verify that deliverables meet specified requirements before accepting the final project output (Turner, 2016).

**End User Involvement:**

1. **Requirements input:** End users provide detailed operational requirements based on their practical experience and needs (Office of Government Commerce, 2009).

2. **User acceptance testing:** End users test deliverables to ensure they meet operational needs and are fit for purpose (Association for Project Management, 2019).

3. **Feedback provision:** End users provide feedback on prototypes, designs, and interim deliverables (Kerzner, 2017).

4. **Change adoption:** End users implement new ways of working required by project outputs (Project Management Institute, 2021).

### Example: Customer vs End User

**Scenario:** Automated warehouse management system project

**Customer:** Warehouse Operations Director
- Commissioned the project with £800k budget
- Required 20% improvement in order processing speed
- Will accept final system and sign off project completion
- Focused on ROI and strategic logistics improvements

**End Users:** Warehouse operatives and supervisors
- Will use the system daily for order picking and inventory management
- Need intuitive interface that works with existing processes
- Concerned about training requirements and workload during transition
- Focused on practical usability and error prevention

**Project Implications:**
- The project manager must balance cost constraints (customer priority) with interface design and training (end user priority)
- Requirements gathering involved both customer workshops (strategic requirements) and end user focus groups (operational requirements)
- Testing included both formal acceptance testing (customer) and usability testing (end users)

## 7. Other Stakeholders
**Time: 61-71 minutes**

### Consultants and Contractors

Many engineering projects involve external specialists who contribute specific expertise or capacity (Turner, 2016). These stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities:

**Consultants:**

Consultants provide specialist advice, expertise, or services that are not available within the project team (Association for Project Management, 2019). In engineering contexts, consultants might include:

- Specialist design engineers (e.g., geotechnical consultants for foundation design)
- Technical advisers (e.g., acoustic consultants for noise control)
- Process improvement specialists (e.g., lean manufacturing consultants)
- Regulatory compliance experts (e.g., environmental consultants)

**Consultant Responsibilities:**
1. Provide expert advice within their domain of expertise
2. Produce specific deliverables as defined in their scope of work
3. Meet quality and timeliness requirements
4. Collaborate effectively with internal project team members

**Contractors:**

Contractors undertake specific work packages or supply products/services under a commercial contract (Cleland and Ireland, 2016). Examples include:

- Main contractors (responsible for overall construction or implementation)
- Subcontractors (specialist trades or services)
- Equipment suppliers
- Software developers

**Contractor Responsibilities:**
1. Execute work according to specifications and standards
2. Manage their own resources and subcontractors
3. Meet schedule and quality requirements
4. Comply with health, safety, and regulatory requirements
5. Provide progress reports and documentation

### Managing External Stakeholders

Effective management of consultants and contractors requires clear contractual arrangements, defined interfaces, and robust communication mechanisms (Kerzner, 2017):

- **Clear scope definition:** Detailed specifications of deliverables and performance standards
- **Interface management:** Coordination between external parties and internal team members
- **Performance monitoring:** Regular assessment of progress and quality
- **Contract administration:** Management of commercial terms, variations, and payments

### Additional Stakeholders

Engineering projects typically involve numerous other stakeholders whose interests must be considered (Project Management Institute, 2021):

**Regulatory Bodies:**
- Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
- Environment Agency
- Local planning authorities
- Industry-specific regulators (e.g., Civil Aviation Authority)

**Community and Public:**
- Local residents affected by construction
- Environmental groups
- Public interest organisations

**Internal Stakeholders:**
- Departments affected by project outputs (e.g., operations, maintenance)
- Support functions (e.g., procurement, IT, facilities)
- Trade unions or employee representatives

**Supply Chain:**
- Raw material suppliers
- Equipment manufacturers
- Logistics providers

### Example: Stakeholder Network

For a renewable energy project (wind turbine installation):

**Consultants:**
- Wind resource assessment consultant
- Environmental impact assessment consultant
- Grid connection design consultant

**Contractors:**
- Main contractor (turbine installation)
- Civil engineering contractor (foundations)
- Electrical contractor (grid connection)
- Equipment supplier (turbine manufacturer)

**Regulatory Stakeholders:**
- Local planning authority (planning permission)
- Aviation authority (height restrictions)
- Grid operator (connection approval)
- Environmental regulator (habitat protection)

**Community Stakeholders:**
- Local residents (noise and visual impact concerns)
- Environmental groups (wildlife protection interests)
- Local businesses (construction traffic concerns)

## 8. RACI Matrices and Organisational Charts
**Time: 71-83 minutes**

### RACI Matrices

#### What is a RACI Matrix?

A RACI matrix is a responsibility assignment tool that clarifies who does what on a project (Project Management Institute, 2021). RACI is an acronym representing four levels of responsibility:

- **R = Responsible:** The person who does the work to complete the task
- **A = Accountable:** The person ultimately answerable for correct completion (only one person should be accountable for each task)
- **C = Consulted:** People who provide input and with whom there is two-way communication
- **I = Informed:** People who are kept up-to-date on progress, typically through one-way communication

#### Benefits of RACI Matrices

RACI matrices provide numerous advantages for project management (Association for Project Management, 2019):

1. **Clarity:** Everyone understands their role and responsibilities
2. **Accountability:** One person is clearly accountable for each deliverable
3. **Efficiency:** Duplication of effort is minimised
4. **Communication:** Consultation and information needs are defined
5. **Conflict reduction:** Role ambiguity is eliminated

#### Creating a RACI Matrix

A RACI matrix is typically presented in tabular format with tasks/deliverables listed vertically and roles listed horizontally (Turner, 2016). Each cell contains R, A, C, or I (or is left blank if the role has no involvement).

#### Example RACI Matrix: Engineering Project

### Organisational Charts

#### Purpose of Organisational Charts

Organisational charts provide visual representation of project structure, showing reporting relationships, authority levels, and communication channels (Kerzner, 2017). For engineering projects, organisational charts help stakeholders understand:

- Who reports to whom
- Spans of control
- Interfaces between different teams or departments
- Overall project governance structure

#### Example Organisational Chart

## 11. Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Crossrail Project - Role Clarity in Mega-Projects

#### Background

Crossrail, now known as the Elizabeth Line, is Europe's largest construction project, involving the construction of 42km of new tunnels beneath London and connecting 41 stations (Crossrail Ltd, 2018). The £18.8 billion project required exceptional governance and role clarity due to its scale, complexity, and multitude of stakeholders.

#### Role Structure

The Crossrail project established a sophisticated governance structure (National Audit Office, 2014):

**Project Sponsor:** Department for Transport and Transport for London (joint sponsors)
- Defined strategic objectives and secured government funding
- Maintained oversight of overall project delivery
- Managed stakeholder relationships with government and London authorities

**Project Board:** Crossrail Ltd Board of Directors
- Comprised executive and non-executive directors with transport, engineering, and finance expertise
- Provided strategic direction and oversight
- Made key decisions on scope, cost, and schedule
- Met monthly to review progress

**Project Manager:** Chief Executive Officer of Crossrail Ltd
- Overall responsibility for project delivery
- Led executive team covering all project aspects
- Reported to board and sponsors
- Managed relationships with contractors and stakeholders

**Specialist Roles:**
- Programme Director (coordinated all project elements)
- Engineering Director (technical oversight)
- Commercial Director (contract management)
- Multiple project managers for different geographic sections
- Hundreds of design engineers, construction managers, and specialists

#### Key Lessons

**Success Factor 1 - Clear Governance:**
The project established clear reporting lines and decision-making authorities from the outset. This prevented delays and ensured accountability (National Audit Office, 2014).

**Success Factor 2 - Role Specialisation:**
By creating specialist roles for different aspects (tunnelling, stations, systems, testing), the project effectively managed its enormous complexity (Crossrail Ltd, 2018).

**Challenge - Role Multiplication:**
The sheer number of roles and interfaces created coordination challenges. Crossrail addressed this through sophisticated communication protocols and interface management processes (National Audit Office, 2014).

#### Relevance to Learning

This case demonstrates:
- How role structures scale to project complexity
- The importance of governance in large projects
- How specialist roles enable effective management of technical complexity
- The relationship between clear roles and project accountability

### Case Study 2: Thames Tideway Tunnel - Stakeholder Role Management

#### Background

The Thames Tideway Tunnel is a 25km super sewer being constructed beneath the River Thames to prevent sewage overflow into the river (Thames Tideway, 2021). The £4.2 billion project involves complex stakeholder management with multiple communities, environmental groups, and regulatory bodies.

#### Role Challenges

**Customer vs. End User Complexity:**
- **Customer:** Thames Water (water utility company) commissioned and funds the project
- **Primary End User:** Thames Water (will operate the completed tunnel)
- **Secondary End Users:** London residents (will benefit from cleaner Thames)
- **Affected Parties:** Residents near construction sites (experience disruption)

This created challenges in balancing different stakeholder needs (Thames Tideway, 2021).

#### Governance Response

The project established innovative governance arrangements (National Infrastructure Commission, 2018):

**Independent Project Company:** Thames Tideway Tunnel Ltd (not part of Thames Water)
- Created to provide independent oversight
- Board includes independent directors and Thames Water representatives
- Provides checks and balances on decision-making

**Community Liaison Officers:**
- Dedicated roles to engage with affected communities
- Separate from construction management roles
- Ensured community concerns reached board-level decision-makers

**Environmental Managers:**
- Dedicated roles to ensure environmental compliance
- Direct reporting line to project board (not just operational management)
- Authority to stop work if environmental standards at risk

**Regulatory Interface Managers:**
- Specialist roles to manage relationships with Environment Agency and other regulators
- Ensured project maintained regulatory compliance
- Facilitated timely decision-making on regulatory matters

#### Key Lessons

**Lesson 1 - Stakeholder-Specific Roles:**
Creating dedicated roles for community and environmental engagement ensured these critical aspects received appropriate attention (Thames Tideway, 2021).

**Lesson 2 - Independent Governance:**
The independent project company structure provided objectivity in decision-making and enhanced stakeholder confidence (National Infrastructure Commission, 2018).

**Lesson 3 - Direct Access to Board:**
Giving community liaison and environmental managers direct board access ensured their concerns influenced strategic decisions, not just operational ones (Thames Tideway, 2021).

#### Relevance to Learning

This case demonstrates:
- The distinction between customers, end users, and affected parties
- How role structures can be adapted to manage diverse stakeholder needs
- The value of creating specialist stakeholder management roles
- How governance structures can provide checks and balances

## 12. Conclusion and Key Takeaways

### Summary of Key Concepts

This lecture has explored the critical importance of clearly defined roles and responsibilities in engineering project management. The key concepts covered include:

1. **Hierarchical Structure:** Engineering projects require governance structures that provide strategic oversight (sponsor and board), tactical management (project manager), and operational execution (team leaders and members).

2. **Role Clarity:** Each role has specific duties and responsibilities. Ambiguity in roles leads to inefficiency, conflict, and project failure.

3. **Diverse Stakeholders:** Projects involve multiple stakeholders beyond the core team, including customers, end users, consultants, contractors, and regulatory bodies. Each has distinct interests and contributions.

4. **Tools for Clarity:** RACI matrices and organisational charts provide mechanisms for documenting and communicating roles and responsibilities effectively.

5. **Practical Application:** Role clarity is not merely theoretical; it directly impacts project decision-making, communication, and success, as demonstrated through the role-play activity and case studies.

### Connecting to Learning Outcomes

This session has addressed Learning Outcome 2.1 by:
- Identifying each major project management role
- Explaining the reasons for each role
- Describing the key duties and responsibilities of each role
- Demonstrating how roles interact through practical activities
- Analysing real-world examples of role structures in engineering projects

### Key Takeaway Message

Clear definition of roles and responsibilities is foundational to engineering project success. Whilst tools such as RACI matrices and organisational charts provide structure, effective role management ultimately depends on clear communication, mutual understanding, and respect for the contribution that each role makes to project outcomes.
