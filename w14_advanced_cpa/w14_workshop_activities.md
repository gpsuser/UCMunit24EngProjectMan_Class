### Question 5: Float Time Analysis [5 marks]

**Context**: An offshore wind turbine installation project has the following activity data:

```
Activity Table:

| Activity | Duration | EST | LFT |
|          | (weeks)  |     |     |
+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| A        |    3     |  0  |  3  |
| B        |    5     |  3  |  8  |
| C        |    4     |  3  |  11 |
| D        |    6     |  8  |  14 |
| E        |    3     |  11 |  14 |
+----------+----------+-----+-----+

Dependencies:
A → B, C
B → D
C → E
D, E → Project End
```

**(a)** Calculate the total float for each activity. [3 marks]

```
Activity A: Total Float = ________ weeks

Activity B: Total Float = ________ weeks

Activity C: Total Float = ________ weeks

Activity D: Total Float = ________ weeks

Activity E: Total Float = ________ weeks
```

**(b)** Identify the critical path through the network. [1 mark]

```
Critical Path: _________________________________
```

**(c)** If Activity C is delayed by 5 weeks, will this affect the project completion date? Explain your answer. [1 mark]

```
Explanation:





```

**Marks available**: 5

### Question 6: Multiple Critical Paths [4 marks]

**Context**: A bridge construction project has two parallel work streams that must both be completed:

```
Path 1 (North approach): Activities N1 → N2 → N3
    Total duration: 16 weeks

Path 2 (South approach): Activities S1 → S2 → S3  
    Total duration: 16 weeks

Both paths must complete before final bridge deck installation.
```

**(a)** Explain why having multiple critical paths increases project risk compared to having a single critical path. [2 marks]

```
Explanation:








```

**(b)** The project manager is considering allocating additional resources to accelerate one of the paths. Explain why this strategy would **not** reduce the overall project duration in this scenario. [2 marks]

```
Explanation:








```

**Marks available**: 4

### Question 7: Schedule Compression Techniques [6 marks]

**Context**: A pharmaceutical manufacturing facility upgrade project is running 3 weeks behind schedule. The project manager must decide between two schedule compression techniques:

**Option A - Crashing**: Add night shift workers to critical activities
- Cost: £80,000 per week saved
- Can save maximum 3 weeks
- Quality risk: Low

**Option B - Fast-tracking**: Begin equipment installation before design is 100% complete  
- Cost: £15,000 (coordination overhead)
- Can save maximum 4 weeks  
- Quality risk: High (potential rework if design changes)

The contractual penalty for late completion is £60,000 per week.

**(a)** Calculate the total cost of using Option A (Crashing) to recover the full 3-week delay. [1 mark]

```
Calculation:



Total Cost = £__________
```

**(b)** Compare the financial cost of Option A with the penalty cost if no action is taken. Which option costs less? [1 mark]

```
Option A cost: £__________

Penalty cost: £__________

Lower cost option: __________
```

**(c)** Despite the higher financial cost, explain **two reasons** why the project manager might still choose Option A (Crashing) over accepting the penalties. [2 marks]

```
Reason 1:




Reason 2:




```

**(d)** Evaluate the suitability of Option B (Fast-tracking) for this pharmaceutical project, considering the industry context. [2 marks]

## Assessment Criteria Reference

- Critical path network diagrams
- Earliest Start Times (EST)
- Latest Finish Times (LFT)
- Float time for an activity
- Identification of project's critical path

- Delays and adjustments

**LO3.2 Teaching Exemplification**:
"To include the usefulness (advantages and disadvantages) and importance of critical path analysis for project management and the calculation and interpretation of critical path data."

## Notes for Students

**Examination Technique**:

1. **Show your working**: Even if your final answer is incorrect, you can earn marks for correct methodology

2. **Use context**: Higher marks are awarded when you reference the specific scenario (e.g., "Charlie's carbon reduction project" rather than generic answers)

3. **Define technical terms**: When explaining concepts like "float time" or "critical path", demonstrate clear understanding through precise definitions

4. **Structured responses**: For multi-mark questions, use separate paragraphs or bullet points for each distinct point

5. **Check units**: Always include appropriate units (weeks, days, months) in your calculations

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:

- Confusing "benefits of identifying the critical path" with "benefits of critical path analysis" (they are different)
- Forgetting that float time belongs to the project, not individual activities
- Not recalculating the critical path after delays (it may change!)
- Assuming all delays affect project completion (only delays to critical activities do)
- Providing generic answers instead of contextual responses

**Formula Reference**:

```
Total Float = LFT - EST - Duration

Free Float = Earliest EST of successors - EFT of current activity
            where EFT = EST + Duration

An activity is critical if: Total Float = 0
```
