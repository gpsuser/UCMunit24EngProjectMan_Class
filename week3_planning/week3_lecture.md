## Introduction (Time: 0-10 minutes)

Project planning represents the foundation upon which successful engineering projects are built. Without proper planning, even the most innovative engineering solutions can fail to deliver value to stakeholders. This workshop focuses on three critical elements of project planning: setting SMART objectives, resource planning, and basic financial planning.

The importance of systematic planning in engineering cannot be overstated. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI, 2020), organisations that invest in project management practices waste 28 times less money than those that do not. Furthermore, research by McKinsey & Company (2012) indicates that large engineering projects typically run 20% late and 80% over budget, primarily due to inadequate planning phases.

During this session, learners will engage with practical planning tools and methodologies that are directly applicable to real engineering projects, from small-scale component design initiatives to large infrastructure developments.

## SMART Objectives Framework (Time: 10-35 minutes)

### Understanding SMART Criteria

The SMART framework provides a structured approach to objective setting that ensures project goals are clearly defined and achievable. Originally developed by Doran (1981), the SMART criteria have become the gold standard for project objective setting across industries.

```
S.M.A.R.T OBJECTIVES FRAMEWORK
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  S - SPECIFIC    │  Clearly defined and unambiguous        │
│  M - MEASURABLE  │  Quantifiable with defined metrics      │
│  A - AGREED      │  Accepted by all stakeholders          │
│  R - REALISTIC   │  Achievable within constraints          │
│  T - TIME-SPECIFIC│ Defined timeline with clear deadlines  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Specific (S)

Specific objectives eliminate ambiguity and provide clear direction for project teams. In engineering contexts, specificity often relates to technical parameters, performance criteria, or functional requirements. For example, rather than stating "improve engine efficiency," a specific objective would be "increase diesel engine fuel efficiency by reducing specific fuel consumption."

### Measurable (M)

Measurable objectives incorporate quantifiable metrics that allow progress tracking and success evaluation. Engineering projects naturally lend themselves to measurement through technical specifications, performance indicators, and compliance standards. Effective measures include dimensional tolerances, efficiency percentages, cost reductions, or time savings.

### Agreed (A)

Agreed objectives ensure stakeholder alignment and commitment. In engineering projects, this involves securing buy-in from technical teams, management, clients, and regulatory bodies where applicable. The agreement process often requires negotiation between competing interests and constraints.

### Realistic (R)

Realistic objectives balance ambition with practical limitations including technical feasibility, resource availability, and organisational capabilities. Engineering projects must consider physical laws, material properties, manufacturing constraints, and safety requirements when establishing realistic targets.

### Time-Specific (T)

Time-specific objectives establish clear deadlines and milestones that drive project momentum. Engineering projects typically involve multiple phases with interdependent timelines, making temporal specificity crucial for coordination and resource allocation.

### Teaching Examples

**Example 1: Manufacturing Process Improvement**
- Non-SMART: "Improve production line efficiency"
- SMART: "Reduce manufacturing cycle time for automotive brake components by 15% (from 45 to 38 seconds per unit) through automated assembly implementation by 31st March 2024, as agreed with production and quality teams"

**Example 2: Product Development**
- Non-SMART: "Develop better heating system"
- SMART: "Design and prototype an energy-efficient residential heat pump system achieving 350% coefficient of performance (COP), complying with BS EN 14511 standards, within £75,000 development budget by 30th September 2024"

## Resource Planning Fundamentals (Time: 35-60 minutes)

### Understanding Project Resources

Resource planning involves identifying, acquiring, and allocating the necessary inputs required to achieve project objectives. Turner (2014) defines project resources as "the means by which project work is accomplished," encompassing physical, technological, and human elements.

```
PROJECT RESOURCE CATEGORIES
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    PROJECT RESOURCES                        │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤
│   PHYSICAL      │   TECHNOLOGICAL │      HUMAN              │
│                 │                 │                         │
│ • Materials     │ • Software      │ • Project Manager      │
│ • Equipment     │ • Hardware      │ • Design Engineers     │
│ • Tools         │ • Networks      │ • Technicians          │
│ • Facilities    │ • Databases     │ • Specialists          │
│ • Consumables   │ • Systems       │ • Contractors          │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

### Physical Resources

Physical resources encompass tangible assets required for project execution. In engineering contexts, these typically include:

**Materials and Components**
Raw materials, purchased components, and consumables form the physical foundation of engineering projects. Effective planning requires detailed specifications, quality standards, delivery schedules, and storage requirements. For instance, a bridge construction project must plan for steel reinforcement, concrete, fasteners, and protective coatings with precise quantities and delivery timing.

**Equipment and Tools**
Specialised equipment and tools are often critical path items in engineering projects. Planning considerations include availability, calibration requirements, operator training, and maintenance schedules. Computer-aided design (CAD) workstations, testing equipment, and manufacturing machinery represent typical equipment resources.

**Facilities and Space**
Physical workspace, laboratories, manufacturing areas, and storage facilities require careful planning to ensure adequate capacity and appropriate environmental conditions. Clean rooms for semiconductor manufacturing or controlled atmosphere storage for sensitive materials exemplify facility planning requirements.

### Technological Resources

Technological resources enable modern engineering project execution through digital tools and systems.

**Software and Applications**
Engineering software including CAD systems, finite element analysis tools, project management applications, and simulation packages require licensing, training, and technical support planning. Version control and data management systems ensure project information integrity.

**Hardware and Infrastructure**
Computing hardware, servers, networks, and communication systems provide the technological foundation for project execution. Cloud computing resources and cybersecurity measures represent increasingly important technological considerations.

### Human Resources

Human resources represent the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary for project success.

**Project Management Team**
Project managers, coordinators, and administrative personnel provide leadership and coordination functions. Planning must consider experience levels, certification requirements, and management methodologies.

**Technical Personnel**
Engineers, designers, analysts, and technicians provide specialised technical expertise. Resource planning must align skill sets with project requirements and consider training needs for new technologies or methodologies.

**External Resources**
Consultants, contractors, and suppliers provide additional capabilities beyond internal organisational resources. Selection criteria, contract management, and integration challenges require careful planning consideration.

### Resource Planning Process

The systematic approach to resource planning follows a structured methodology:

1. **Resource Identification**: Cataloguing all required resources based on project scope and objectives
2. **Resource Quantification**: Determining quantities, specifications, and quality requirements
3. **Resource Scheduling**: Establishing when resources are needed and for how long
4. **Resource Acquisition**: Planning procurement, hiring, or contracting processes
5. **Resource Allocation**: Assigning resources to specific project activities and timeframes

### Teaching Examples

**Equipment Scheduling Example**
A automotive engine testing project requires dynamometer access for performance validation. Resource planning must consider:
- Equipment specifications and calibration requirements
- Booking schedules and availability conflicts
- Operator training and certification needs
- Data acquisition system compatibility
- Safety protocol compliance

**Material Procurement Example**
A renewable energy project involving solar panel installation requires:
- Photovoltaic modules with specific efficiency ratings
- Mounting hardware suitable for roof conditions
- Electrical components meeting grid connection standards
- Delivery scheduling coordinated with installation phases
- Quality assurance and warranty requirements

## Financial Planning Basics (Time: 70-85 minutes)

### Understanding Project Financial Planning

Financial planning provides the economic framework within which engineering projects operate. Effective financial planning ensures projects deliver value while operating within budgetary constraints and organisational financial policies.

### Budget Development Components

**Direct Costs**
Direct costs are expenses directly attributable to specific project activities. In engineering projects, these typically include:
- Materials and components
- Equipment rental or purchase
- Labour costs for project personnel
- Subcontractor fees
- Testing and certification expenses

**Indirect Costs**
Indirect costs support project activities but cannot be directly attributed to specific tasks. These include:
- Facilities overhead
- Administrative support
- Utilities and communications
- Insurance and legal fees
- Management supervision

**Contingency Allowances**
Engineering projects inherently involve uncertainties that can impact costs. Contingency planning typically allocates 10-20% of total project budget for unforeseen circumstances, with percentages varying based on project complexity and risk levels (Association for Project Management, 2019).

### Sources of Finance

**Internal Sources**
- Retained earnings from previous projects or operations
- Depreciation reserves for equipment replacement
- Working capital reallocation
- Asset disposal proceeds

**External Sources**
- Bank loans and credit facilities
- Government grants and subsidies
- Venture capital or private investment
- Equipment financing and leasing arrangements

### Cost Estimation Techniques

**Bottom-Up Estimation**
Detailed cost estimation beginning with individual work packages and aggregating to total project cost. This method provides high accuracy but requires substantial detail and time investment.

**Top-Down Estimation**
Estimation based on similar projects or industry benchmarks, adjusted for project-specific factors. This approach enables rapid estimation but may lack accuracy for unique or complex projects.

**Parametric Estimation**
Cost estimation using statistical relationships between project characteristics and costs. For example, cost per square metre for building projects or cost per kilowatt for power generation systems.
