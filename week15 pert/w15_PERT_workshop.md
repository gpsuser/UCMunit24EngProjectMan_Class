## Instructions

This workshop contains three sections designed to develop your PERT calculation and interpretation skills:

- **Section A:** Questions from past examination papers (verbatim)
- **Section B:** Adapted versions of examination questions

**Formula Reference:**
```
E = (O + 4M + P) / 6

  O = Optimistic time
  M = Most likely time
  P = Pessimistic time
```

**General Guidance:**
- Show all working clearly
- Include appropriate units in your final answers
- Round to 2 decimal places where necessary
- Ensure your final answer is clearly indicated

## SECTION A: Past Examination Questions

These questions are taken directly from previous examination papers and reflect the standard and style of assessment you can expect.

### Question 1 (7 marks)
**Source:** June 2023 Examination Paper, Question 3(a)

An engineering project manager is estimating the duration for a critical project phase. The project involves complex integration work with uncertainty about the actual duration required.

The manager has provided the following time estimates for the integration phase:
- Optimistic time (O) = 7 months
- Most likely time (M) = 10 months

The manager is considering two scenarios for the pessimistic time estimate:

**Scenario 1:** Pessimistic time (P) = 16 months  
**Scenario 2:** Pessimistic time (P) = 28 months

**Required:**

**(a)** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) for Scenario 1.  
**(b)** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) for Scenario 2.  
**(c)** Determine the difference in estimated expected duration between the two scenarios.  
**(d)** State your answer with appropriate units.

**[7 marks: 2 marks for each correct E calculation, 2 marks for correct difference calculation, 1 mark for units]**

### Question 2 (2 marks)
**Source:** January 2023 Examination Paper, Question 3(b)(ii)

Johnny is the project manager for a healthcare equipment installation project. He has used PERT to estimate the duration of the equipment commissioning phase. However, Johnny has made several assumptions that may affect the accuracy of his estimates:

- He assumed that all regulatory inspections would be completed within the optimistic timeframe
- He based his most likely estimate on a single similar project from 5 years ago
- He did not consult with the equipment suppliers when setting his pessimistic estimate
- He ignored potential delays from staff training requirements

**Required:**

Identify **two** reasons why Johnny's PERT estimation is likely to be inaccurate based on his unrealistic assumptions.

**[2 marks: 1 mark for each valid reason]**

## SECTION B: Adapted Examination Questions

These questions are based on past examination questions but have been modified to provide additional practice with different scenarios and values.

### Question 3 (8 marks)
**Adapted from:** June 2023 Examination Paper, Question 3(a)

A civil engineering firm is planning the construction phase of a new pedestrian bridge. The project manager needs to estimate the duration for the foundation work, which has significant uncertainty due to unknown ground conditions.

The project manager has gathered the following time estimates for the foundation phase:
- Optimistic time (O) = 5 weeks
- Most likely time (M) = 8 weeks

The project manager is evaluating two risk scenarios based on different ground condition possibilities:

**Scenario A:** Pessimistic time (P) = 14 weeks (moderate ground complications)  
**Scenario B:** Pessimistic time (P) = 22 weeks (severe ground complications)

**Required:**

**(a)** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) for Scenario A.  
**(b)** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) for Scenario B.  
**(c)** Calculate the difference in estimated expected duration between the two scenarios.  
**(d)** Explain what this difference tells the project manager about the risk associated with ground conditions. State your answer with appropriate units.

**[8 marks: 2 marks for each E calculation, 2 marks for difference calculation, 1 mark for explanation, 1 mark for units]**

### Question 4 (4 marks)
**Adapted from:** January 2023 Examination Paper, Question 3(b)(ii)

Sarah is managing an aerospace component testing project. She has used PERT to estimate the duration of the prototype testing phase. Her approach included the following:

- She set the optimistic time based on the theoretical minimum test duration from the test protocol
- Her most likely estimate was based on averaging three different types of tests that have very different durations
- She established the pessimistic time by doubling the most likely time
- She did not account for potential equipment calibration delays between tests

**Required:**

**(a)** Identify **two** specific weaknesses in Sarah's approach to developing PERT estimates.  
**(b)** For each weakness identified, briefly explain why it would reduce the accuracy of the PERT estimate.

**[4 marks: 1 mark for each weakness identification, 1 mark for each explanation]**

## SECTION C: New Application Questions

These questions are designed to extend your understanding of PERT and its application in engineering project management contexts.

### Question 5 (5 marks)

An automotive manufacturing plant is implementing a new robotic assembly system. The project involves four sequential phases. The project manager has developed PERT estimates for each phase as shown in the table below:

```
+-------------------+------+------+------+
| Phase             |  O   |  M   |  P   |
+-------------------+------+------+------+
| Equipment Delivery| 4 wk | 6 wk | 10 wk|
| Site Preparation  | 2 wk | 3 wk | 6 wk |
| Installation      | 5 wk | 8 wk | 14 wk|
| Commissioning     | 3 wk | 4 wk | 7 wk |
+-------------------+------+------+------+
```

**Required:**

**(a)** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) for each phase.  
**(b)** Calculate the total estimated expected project duration.  
**(c)** Identify which phase has the greatest uncertainty (largest range between O and P).

**[5 marks: 0.5 marks per phase E calculation, 1 mark for total duration, 1 mark for identifying highest uncertainty phase]**

### Question 6 (6 marks)

A pharmaceutical company is planning a regulatory approval process for a new manufacturing facility. The project manager has provided the following estimates for the approval phase:

- Optimistic time (O) = 6 months (fast-track approval with no queries)
- Most likely time (M) = 11 months (standard processing time)
- Pessimistic time (P) = 20 months (multiple inspection rounds required)

**Required:**

**(a)** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) for the regulatory approval phase. Show all working.  
**(b)** The company's board of directors wants to know the "most likely" completion time to report to shareholders. Explain why the project manager should recommend using the PERT estimate (E) rather than the most likely time (M) for stakeholder communication.  
**(c)** Calculate the range of uncertainty for this phase (P - O) and comment on what this tells you about the predictability of regulatory approval processes.

**[6 marks: 2 marks for calculation, 2 marks for explanation, 1 mark for range calculation, 1 mark for interpretation]**

### Question 7 (4 marks)

Two engineering projects are being planned. Project Alpha involves installing standard equipment in a factory using proven technology and experienced contractors. Project Beta involves developing and implementing a prototype renewable energy system using new technology.

**Project Alpha estimates:**
- Optimistic: 8 weeks
- Most likely: 9 weeks  
- Pessimistic: 11 weeks

**Project Beta estimates:**
- Optimistic: 8 weeks
- Most likely: 14 weeks
- Pessimistic: 26 weeks

**Required:**

**(a)** Calculate the estimated expected time (E) for both projects.  
**(b)** Compare the two projects and explain which project would benefit more from using PERT rather than simple single-point estimation. Justify your answer by referring to the characteristics of each project.

**[4 marks: 1 mark for each E calculation, 2 marks for comparison and justified explanation]**
