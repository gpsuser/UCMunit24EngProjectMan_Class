## Scenario Context

**Midlands Railway Modernisation Project**

Network Railway Ltd, a major UK railway infrastructure operator, has initiated a project to modernise signalling systems across 85 kilometres of track in the Midlands region. The project aims to replace aging mechanical signalling with digital European Train Control System (ETCS) technology.

**Project Overview:**
- **Purpose**: Improve safety, increase line capacity and reduce maintenance costs
- **Duration**: 18 months (planned completion by December 2026)
- **Budget**: £47 million
- **Key Deliverables**: Installation of 23 digital signal control points, control centre upgrade, train-borne equipment installation on 120 trains and staff training programme

**Project Team:**
- **Project Sponsor**: Regional Operations Director
- **Project Manager**: Sarah Chen (15 years railway engineering experience)
- **Team Leaders**: Signal Engineering Lead, Software Development Lead, Training & Implementation Lead
- **Team Members**: 35 personnel (engineers, technicians, software developers, trainers)
- **Key Stakeholders**: Rail regulator, train operating companies, local authorities, passengers

**Current Status**: The project is in the planning stage (Week 8 of the project lifecycle).

**Leadership style selected:**

**When appropriate:**

**Why appropriate:**

---

### Question 8 (6 marks)

Time management is identified as an essential project management skill.

With reference to the Midlands Railway Modernisation Project scenario, evaluate the importance of effective time management skills for the project manager. In your answer, consider both the benefits of good time management and the consequences of poor time management.

**Answer:**

---

## Helpful Hints

### General Guidance

1. **Read questions carefully**: Identify the command word (define, explain, evaluate) and respond accordingly
2. **Use the scenario**: Where questions reference the railway project, apply your knowledge to this specific context
3. **Show your thinking**: For longer questions, structure answers with clear points
4. **Technical terminology**: Use correct project management terminology from the unit specification
5. **Examples strengthen answers**: Where appropriate, reference aspects of the railway scenario
6. **Mark allocation guides depth**: A 2-mark question needs less detail than an 8-mark question

### Command Word Guidance

- **Define** (1-2 marks): Provide a clear, precise meaning
- **State/Identify** (1 mark each): Brief, factual responses
- **Explain** (2-4 marks): Give reasons, causes or how something works
- **Evaluate** (5-8 marks): Weigh evidence, consider multiple perspectives, make judgements

### Specific Question Hints

**Question 1**: Think about the very beginning of a project - what needs to be established?

**Question 2**: Communication strategies cover who needs information, what information, when and how.

**Question 3**: Consider physical items, technology and people as distinct resource categories.

**Question 4**: Power refers to decision-making authority; interest refers to concern about project outcomes.

**Question 5**: Think about what a project manager does on a daily basis to keep the project moving.

**Question 6**: Consider whether to avoid, reduce or manage conflict, and specific techniques.

**Question 7**: Remember Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model (directive, supportive, collaborative, responsive).

**Question 8**: Consider impacts on schedule, costs, team morale, stakeholder confidence and project success.
