## 1. Introduction and Objectives (5 minutes)

### Session Overview

This session represents a critical milestone in the Unit 24 learning journey. Having completed the first two phases covering project stages and project management roles, learners now consolidate their understanding through comprehensive review and formative assessment.

### Session Objectives

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

1. Demonstrate comprehensive understanding of all four project management stages and their sequential nature
2. Articulate the roles, responsibilities and interrelationships within project management structures
3. Evaluate and apply essential project management skills across various engineering contexts
4. Respond effectively to exam-style questions using appropriate terminology and structured approaches
5. Identify personal knowledge gaps and develop targeted revision strategies


## 2. LO1 Comprehensive Review: Understanding Project Stages (20 minutes)

### 2.1 The Sequential Nature of Project Management

Project management in engineering contexts follows a structured, sequential approach comprising four distinct yet interconnected stages. Burke (2013) emphasises that the success of engineering projects depends fundamentally upon rigorous adherence to this staged methodology, as each phase builds upon the foundations established in the previous stage.

The four stages operate consecutively:

```
STAGE 1          STAGE 2          STAGE 3              STAGE 4
[INITIATION] --> [PLANNING] --> [IMPLEMENTATION] --> [CLOSURE]
     |               |                |                   |
  Define the     Design the       Execute the         Complete &
  project        approach         project             evaluate
```

### 2.2 Stage 1: Project Initiation (LO1.1)

Project initiation establishes the fundamental parameters within which the project will operate. Kerzner (2017) identifies this stage as having the highest impact on ultimate project success, as decisions made during initiation constrain all subsequent activities.

#### Key Components of Initiation

**Project Proposal**

The project proposal articulates three critical elements. The purpose defines why the project exists and what organisational need it addresses. The aims specify what the project intends to achieve in broad terms. The scope delineates clear boundaries, identifying what falls within and outside project parameters. Finally, deliverables represent the tangible outputs that will demonstrate project completion (Project Management Institute, 2017).

**Feasibility Study**

Feasibility assessment determines project viability through systematic analysis. Cost analysis quantifies all anticipated expenditures across the project lifecycle. Justification demonstrates how project benefits outweigh costs and risks, typically expressed through return on investment (ROI) calculations or cost-benefit analysis. Turner (2014) notes that inadequate feasibility analysis represents a primary cause of engineering project failures.

**Project Controls**

Three interrelated constraints govern project delivery, commonly termed the iron triangle. Time strategies establish scheduling frameworks and milestone achievement. Cost controls implement budget management and expenditure tracking. Quality strategies ensure deliverables meet specified standards and fitness-for-purpose requirements. These three elements exist in constant tension, as improving one typically requires compromising another (Atkinson, 1999).

**Communication Strategy**

Effective communication underpins project success across all stages. The communication strategy specifies reporting structures, information sharing protocols, stakeholder engagement approaches and escalation procedures. Müller and Turner (2007) demonstrate direct correlation between communication quality and project outcomes in engineering contexts.

### 2.3 Stage 2: Project Planning (LO1.2)

Project planning translates initiation concepts into actionable frameworks. The Planning stage generates comprehensive documentation that guides project execution. Meredith and Mantel (2012) identify planning as the most time-intensive stage, typically consuming 20-30% of total project effort.

#### The Eight Elements of Project Planning

**Outline Plan**

The outline plan expands upon initiation documentation to provide comprehensive project definition. SMART objectives transform broad aims into specific, measurable, agreed, realistic and time-specific targets. Constraints identify limitations on project delivery, including regulatory, technical, financial and temporal restrictions. The outline plan establishes targets against which project performance will be measured (Doran, 1981).

**Resource Plan**

Resource planning identifies, quantifies and schedules all inputs required for project delivery. Physical resources include facilities, equipment, tools, materials and consumables. Technological resources encompass hardware, software, networks and technical infrastructure. Human resources specify personnel requirements, including skills, quantities, timing and duration. The resource plan addresses what resources are needed, where they must be located, when they are required and how they will be procured (Lock, 2017).

**Financial Plan**

Financial planning translates resource requirements into monetary terms. Budget spend profiles distribute anticipated expenditure across the project timeline. Costing calculates unit and total costs for all project activities and deliverables. Pricing determines the total project cost and revenue implications. Sources of finance identify funding mechanisms, whether internal reserves, external borrowing, or mixed approaches, considering short, medium and long-term financing options and debt-equity ratios (Brigham and Ehrhardt, 2016).

**Quality Plan**

Quality planning establishes standards and verification mechanisms. Quality targets specify measurable criteria that deliverables must achieve. Quality control methods describe inspection, testing and validation procedures that ensure targets are met. The quality plan implements prevention-focused approaches rather than detection-focused methodologies, aligning with total quality management principles (Juran and De Feo, 2010).

**Stakeholder Analysis**

Stakeholder analysis identifies all parties with interest in or influence over project outcomes. The power-interest matrix classifies stakeholders along two dimensions. Low power, low interest stakeholders require monitoring. High interest, low power stakeholders need regular information. Low interest, high power stakeholders must be kept satisfied. High interest, high power stakeholders demand close, active management (Mendelow, 1991).

```
POWER-INTEREST MATRIX

High Power  |  KEEP SATISFIED  |  MANAGE CLOSELY  |
            |                  |                   |
            |  (e.g. Senior    |  (e.g. Project    |
            |   Management)    |   Sponsor)        |
            |__________________|___________________|
            |                  |                   |
Low Power   |  MONITOR         |  KEEP INFORMED    |
            |                  |                   |
            |  (e.g. General   |  (e.g. Project    |
            |   Staff)         |   Team)           |
            |__________________|___________________|
              Low Interest        High Interest
```

**Risk Analysis**

Risk analysis systematically identifies potential threats to project success. Each risk requires identification of its nature, assessment of severity (impact magnitude), evaluation of likelihood (probability of occurrence) and assignment to risk owners responsible for mitigation. Risks differ from hazards; risks represent uncertain future events whilst hazards represent existing dangerous conditions (Hillson and Murray-Webster, 2017).

**Contingency Plan**

Contingency planning allocates additional time and budget to address potential risks. Contingencies specifically address resource-related uncertainties in physical resources (equipment failure, supply disruption), technological resources (software bugs, technical obsolescence) and human resources (staff turnover, skills gaps). Chapman and Ward (2003) recommend contingencies of 10-20% for engineering projects of moderate complexity.

**Project Schedule**

The project schedule sequences all activities, identifies dependencies and allocates timeframes. The schedule specifies which activities must be completed, in what order, with what duration and what resources. Scheduling tools including Gantt charts and critical path analysis provide visual representation and analytical capability (Harrison and Lock, 2017).

### 2.4 Stage 3: Project Implementation (LO1.3)

Implementation transforms plans into reality through execution, monitoring and control activities. Nicholas and Steyn (2017) identify implementation as the highest-risk stage, where theoretical planning confronts practical reality.

#### Implementation Components

**Execution**

Execution mobilises resources, assigns tasks and commences project activities according to the schedule. Issue logs document problems, obstacles and deviations as they arise, recording nature, severity, responsibility and resolution. Reporting maintains stakeholder awareness through regular status updates aligned with the communication strategy (Kerzner, 2017).

**Monitoring**

Monitoring compares actual performance against the project schedule through variance analysis. Time variance identifies schedule deviations (ahead or behind plan). Cost variance quantifies budget overruns or underspends. Quality variance assesses deliverable conformance to specifications. Earned Value Management provides integrated analysis across all three constraint dimensions (Fleming and Koppelman, 2016).

**Control**

Control implements corrective actions when monitoring reveals deviations. Change control procedures evaluate, approve or reject proposed modifications to scope, schedule or budget. Corrective actions address identified problems. Proactive adjustments anticipate future issues. Reactive adjustments respond to emerged problems. The project board or steering committee typically holds authority for major control decisions (Turner, 2014).

### 2.5 Stage 4: Project Closure (LO1.4)

Project closure formally concludes project activities and transitions deliverables to operational status. Despite its importance, closure is frequently neglected in engineering projects, resulting in lost learning opportunities and unclear accountability (Kloppenborg, 2014).

#### Closure Activities

**Final Acceptance**

Final acceptance requires formal confirmation from relevant stakeholders that project deliverables meet specifications and satisfy requirements. Acceptance criteria established during initiation and planning stages provide the evaluation framework. Without formal acceptance, projects lack clear completion point and may experience scope creep or indefinite duration (Project Management Institute, 2017).

**Final Project Report**

The final report documents project performance across all dimensions. The report compares planned versus actual outcomes for time, cost, quality and scope. It identifies successes and failures, analyses causes of deviations and evaluates overall project performance against objectives. Distribution to relevant stakeholders ensures organisational awareness and accountability (Meredith and Mantel, 2012).

**Stakeholder Feedback**

Feedback collection gathers stakeholder perspectives on project management quality and deliverable satisfaction. Both objective measures (completion metrics) and subjective assessments (satisfaction surveys, interviews) contribute to comprehensive evaluation. Stakeholder feedback informs final project assessment and identifies areas for improvement (Müller and Turner, 2007).

**Lessons Learned**

Lessons learned capture project knowledge for organisational benefit. Strengths identify practices that worked well and should be replicated. Weaknesses highlight problems that should be avoided or mitigated in future projects. Areas for improvement suggest enhancements to methodologies, tools or skills. Lessons learned should be documented, disseminated and incorporated into organisational knowledge management systems (Schindler and Eppler, 2003).

## 3. LO2 Comprehensive Review: Project Management Roles and Skills (20 minutes)

### 3.1 Project Management Roles (LO2.1)

Engineering projects require coordinated effort across multiple organisational roles. Role clarity prevents duplication, gaps and confusion whilst ensuring accountability (Belbin, 2010).

#### Key Project Roles

**Project Sponsor**

The project sponsor provides executive-level authority and strategic direction. Sponsors secure funding, remove organisational obstacles, make high-level decisions and champion the project to senior management. The sponsor typically sits outside the project team but maintains close involvement in critical decisions (Kloppenborg, 2014).

**Project Board/Steering Committee**

The project board provides governance oversight, typically comprising senior managers from affected departments plus the project sponsor. The board reviews progress, approves major changes, resolves resource conflicts and ensures alignment with organisational strategy. Board meetings occur at defined intervals, usually monthly or at major milestones (Turner, 2014).

**Project Manager**

The project manager holds operational responsibility for day-to-day project delivery. Responsibilities include planning, scheduling, resource allocation, team coordination, stakeholder communication, risk management, problem-solving and reporting. The project manager balances competing demands of time, cost and quality whilst maintaining team motivation and stakeholder satisfaction. Crawford (2005) identifies project manager competence as the strongest predictor of project success in engineering contexts.

**Project Team Leaders**

In larger projects, team leaders supervise specialist work packages or sub-teams. Team leaders translate project manager directives into specific task assignments, monitor team member performance, resolve operational issues and report progress. Team leaders require both technical expertise in their specialisation and interpersonal skills for team management (Thamhain, 2013).

**Project Team Members**

Team members execute assigned tasks according to specifications and schedules. Responsibilities include task completion, quality assurance, problem reporting, collaboration with colleagues and compliance with project procedures. Effective team members demonstrate technical competence, reliability, communication skills and commitment to project success (Belbin, 2010).

**End User/Customer**

End users represent the parties who will ultimately utilise project deliverables. Their involvement ensures deliverables meet actual needs rather than assumed requirements. Users contribute to requirements definition, provide feedback during development and validate final deliverables (Kerzner, 2017).

**Other Stakeholders**

Consultants provide specialist expertise not available within the organisation. Contractors deliver specific work packages under defined terms. Suppliers provide materials, equipment or services. Regulators ensure compliance with legal and safety requirements. Each stakeholder category requires tailored management approaches (Project Management Institute, 2017).

### 3.2 Essential Project Management Skills (LO2.2)

Effective project management requires diverse capabilities spanning technical, interpersonal and cognitive domains. Müller and Turner (2007) demonstrate that project manager skills contribute more to project success than methodological factors in engineering contexts.

#### Core Project Management Skills

**Planning**

Planning encompasses scheduling activities, assigning responsibilities and adjusting plans dynamically as circumstances change. Effective planning requires understanding task dependencies, realistic duration estimation and resource availability assessment. Planning converts strategic objectives into operational roadmaps (Kerzner, 2017).

**Time Management**

Time management involves accurate task duration estimation, realistic schedule development, progress measurement and schedule maintenance. Critical time management skills include identifying time-critical activities, managing parallel workstreams and recovering schedule slippage. The project manager must keep projects on track whilst meeting all agreed deadlines despite inevitable disruptions (Lock, 2017).

**Decision-Making**

Decision-making requires critical thinking and systematic problem-solving. Effective decisions balance competing factors including cost, quality, time, risk and stakeholder interests. Decision-making processes should be transparent, logical and evidence-based. Poor decisions cascade through projects, amplifying negative consequences (Kloppenborg, 2014).

**Communication**

Communication represents the most frequently cited project management skill. Effective communication adapts to audience needs, selecting appropriate channels (written reports, meetings, presentations, informal conversations), ensuring appropriate timing, maintaining high quality and achieving fitness for purpose. Internal communication coordinates team activities whilst external communication manages stakeholder expectations. Approximately 90% of project manager time involves communication activities (Project Management Institute, 2017).

**Negotiation**

Negotiation secures resources, resolves conflicts and achieves mutually acceptable outcomes. Project managers negotiate with sponsors (for funding and authority), stakeholders (for cooperation and support), resource holders (for personnel and equipment), team leaders (for commitment and delivery) and team members (for effort and quality). Effective negotiation seeks win-win outcomes that satisfy all parties' core interests (Fisher and Ury, 2011).

**Delegation**

Delegation assigns tasks and authority to team leaders and members whilst retaining ultimate accountability. Effective delegation matches tasks to capabilities, provides clear instructions, grants sufficient authority, monitors progress without micromanaging and provides support when needed. Delegation develops team capabilities whilst freeing project manager time for strategic activities (Turner, 2014).

**Leadership**

Leadership inspires, motivates and directs team efforts towards project objectives. Hersey and Blanchard's (1969) situational leadership model identifies four styles appropriate for different contexts. Directive leadership (telling) suits inexperienced team members requiring clear instruction. Supportive leadership (selling) combines direction with explanation for developing team members. Collaborative leadership (participating) involves experienced team members in decision-making. Responsive leadership (delegating) empowers highly capable team members with autonomy. Effective leaders adapt style to situational requirements.

**Team Building**

Team building transforms individuals into cohesive, high-performing units. Establishing rapport creates positive relationships and mutual respect. Active listening demonstrates valuing team member contributions. Motivation aligns individual interests with project objectives. Tuckman's (1965) model identifies team development stages (forming, storming, norming, performing) requiring different management approaches. Investment in team building significantly improves project performance (Thamhain, 2013).

**Conflict Management**

Conflict inevitably arises from competing priorities, resource constraints and interpersonal tensions. Effective conflict management employs three approaches. Conflict avoidance restructures situations to prevent conflicts emerging. Conflict mitigation reduces conflict intensity through compromise. Managing competing priorities for resources requires transparent decision-making based on organisational objectives. Managing tensions within teams demands understanding underlying causes and addressing root issues rather than symptoms (Thomas and Kilmann, 1974).

**Information Management**

Information management collects, analyses and disseminates project data for decision-making. Cost control requires tracking expenditure against budget. Risk mitigation monitors risk indicators and implements responses. Performance assessment compares actual against planned outcomes. Effective information management provides timely, accurate data supporting informed decisions (Kerzner, 2017).

## 4. General Guidance on Examination Technique and Strategy (10 minutes)

### 4.1 Understanding the Assessment Format

The Unit 24 external examination comprises a two-hour written paper worth 80 marks, based upon an engineering project scenario. Questions range from knowledge recall to analysis and evaluation, with marks distributed according to cognitive demand (OCR, 2017).

#### Mark Allocation Principles

Lower-order questions (1-3 marks) typically assess knowledge and understanding, requiring definitions, explanations or identification. Medium-level questions (4-6 marks) demand application and analysis, requiring learners to apply concepts to scenarios or analyse situations. Higher-order questions (7-10 marks) require evaluation, recommendation and justification, demonstrating critical thinking and professional judgement.

### 4.2 Effective Examination Strategies

#### Time Management

With 120 minutes for 80 marks, learners should allocate approximately 1.5 minutes per mark. A 10-mark question warrants 15 minutes of effort. Time should be distributed proportionally, avoiding spending excessive time on low-value questions whilst neglecting high-value questions.

#### Command Words

Understanding command words is essential for appropriate responses. "Describe" requires detailed account without explanation. "Explain" demands reasons and causes. "Analyse" involves examining components and relationships. "Evaluate" requires weighing evidence and making judgements. "Recommend" needs proposed solutions with justification (OCR, 2017).

#### Structured Responses

High-quality responses demonstrate structure through introduction, developed explanation and conclusion. Using terminology from the unit specification demonstrates technical knowledge. Supporting assertions with examples, whether from case studies or logical scenarios, strengthens responses. Addressing multiple perspectives shows analytical depth.

#### Common Pitfalls

Frequent errors include providing insufficient detail for available marks, failing to relate answers to the given scenario, misinterpreting command words, poor time management leading to incomplete answers and neglecting to demonstrate evaluation in high-mark questions. Awareness of these pitfalls enables proactive avoidance (OCR, 2017).

## 5. Conclusion and Key Takeaways (5 minutes)

### 5.1 Integration of LO1 and LO2

Project management effectiveness requires both systematic process adherence (LO1) and skilled personnel (LO2). The four project stages provide the framework within which project roles operate and management skills are deployed. Successful engineering projects demonstrate excellence across both dimensions.

### 5.2 Preparation for Assessment

The formative assessment in today's workshop provides diagnostic insight into current understanding and identifies areas requiring additional revision. Learners should approach the workshop as examination practice under realistic conditions.
