## 1.0 Introduction and Objectives
**Time: 5 minutes | LO2.2**

### Session Overview

This lecture explores two critical competencies that distinguish effective engineering project managers from those who struggle to deliver successful outcomes: team building and conflict management. These interpersonal skills are particularly important in engineering contexts where projects involve multidisciplinary teams, external contractors, and diverse stakeholders with competing interests.

According to the Project Management Institute, poor communication and inadequate team dynamics are among the leading causes of project failure, accounting for approximately 56% of projects that fail to meet their original goals and objectives (PMI, 2017). In engineering projects, where technical complexity is compounded by human factors, the ability to build cohesive teams and manage conflict effectively becomes paramount to project success.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

1. Explain Tuckman's model of team development and its application to engineering project teams
2. Describe effective team building techniques including establishing rapport, active listening, and team motivation
3. Identify sources of conflict in engineering projects and their potential impacts
4. Evaluate different conflict management strategies and their appropriateness in various project scenarios
5. Analyse the consequences of poor team building and conflict management on project outcomes
6. Recommend courses of action to improve team effectiveness and resolve conflicts in engineering project contexts

### Relevance to Engineering Project Management

Engineering projects present unique team building and conflict management challenges. Projects such as Crossrail, Heathrow Terminal 5, and the Thames Tideway Tunnel have demonstrated that technical excellence alone cannot guarantee project success. Teams comprising civil engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental specialists, and construction professionals must work cohesively despite different technical languages, priorities, and organisational cultures (Brady and Davies, 2014).

The ability to build effective teams and manage conflict constructively is therefore not an optional 'soft skill' but a core competency for engineering project managers that directly impacts project timelines, budgets, and quality outcomes.

## 2.0 Understanding Team Dynamics
**Time: 10 minutes | LO2.2**

### The Nature of Engineering Project Teams

Engineering project teams differ from permanent organisational teams in several important ways:

**Temporary Formation:** Project teams are assembled for a specific purpose and duration, then disbanded upon project completion. This temporary nature affects team cohesion and commitment.

**Multidisciplinary Composition:** Engineering projects require diverse expertise. A single project might include mechanical engineers, software developers, quality assurance specialists, procurement officers, and health and safety coordinators.

**Matrix Structures:** Team members often report to both their functional manager and the project manager, creating potential conflicts of loyalty and priority (Kerzner, 2017).

**Geographical Distribution:** Modern engineering projects frequently involve distributed teams across multiple locations, requiring virtual collaboration tools and careful management of time zones and cultural differences.

**Contractor and Consultant Integration:** Engineering project teams often include external contractors and specialist consultants who may have different organisational cultures and priorities.

### Why Team Building Matters

The benefits of effective team building in engineering projects include:

1. **Enhanced Communication:** Clear channels and shared understanding reduce errors and rework
2. **Improved Problem Solving:** Diverse perspectives lead to more innovative solutions to technical challenges
3. **Increased Productivity:** Cohesive teams work more efficiently with less duplication and conflict
4. **Better Quality Outcomes:** Teams with strong relationships maintain higher quality standards
5. **Reduced Turnover:** Motivated team members are less likely to leave mid-project
6. **Faster Decision Making:** Trust enables quicker consensus on technical and managerial decisions

The limitations of team building efforts include:

1. **Time Investment:** Building team cohesion requires dedicated time that may feel unproductive initially
2. **Individual Differences:** Some personalities may resist team-building activities
3. **Cultural Variations:** What works in one organisational culture may not transfer
4. **Temporary Relationships:** Project team relationships may not endure beyond project completion

## 2.1 Tuckman's Model of Team Development
**Time: 8 minutes | LO2.2**

### Overview of the Model

Bruce Tuckman (1965) developed a widely recognised model describing the stages through which teams progress as they develop. Understanding these stages helps project managers recognise normal team behaviours and intervene appropriately to facilitate team development.

The model comprises five stages: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, and Adjourning. Tuckman later added the fifth stage (Adjourning) in 1977 to account for team dissolution.

```
TUCKMAN'S MODEL OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT

KEY CHARACTERISTICS
─────────────────────
Stage 1: Team members meet, learn roles, establish goals
Stage 2: Competition for status, disagreements on approach
Stage 3: Resolution of differences, developing norms
Stage 4: Focus on task achievement, mutual support
Stage 5: Project completion, disbandment, lessons learned
```

### Stage 1: Forming

**Characteristics:**
- Team members are polite and positive but uncertain about their roles
- Individuals are focused on being accepted by the group
- There is high dependence on the project manager for guidance
- Little agreement on team aims beyond those officially stated
- Individual roles and responsibilities are unclear

**Project Manager Actions:**
- Clearly communicate project objectives, scope, and deliverables
- Define roles and responsibilities using tools such as RACI matrices
- Establish communication protocols and reporting structures
- Facilitate introductions and initial relationship building
- Set clear expectations for behaviour and performance

**Engineering Project Example:** When the Crossrail project established its major works contractors, initial team meetings focused on defining interfaces between different engineering disciplines and establishing governance structures (National Audit Office, 2014).

### Stage 2: Storming

**Characteristics:**
- Team members compete for position and influence
- Disagreements emerge about priorities, methods, and resource allocation
- Some members may challenge the project manager's authority
- Cliques and factions may form
- Productivity typically decreases during this stage

**Project Manager Actions:**
- Remain calm and objective during conflicts
- Focus the team on shared objectives rather than individual agendas
- Facilitate open discussion of differences
- Make decisions when consensus cannot be reached
- Reinforce ground rules and expected behaviours

**Engineering Project Example:** The Heathrow Terminal 5 project experienced significant storming during its construction phase when mechanical, electrical, and building contractors disagreed about responsibility for integrating complex systems, requiring intensive project management intervention (Brady and Davies, 2014).

### Stage 3: Norming

**Characteristics:**
- The team develops working agreements and norms
- Roles and responsibilities become clearer and are accepted
- Trust builds between team members
- Team members begin to socialise and share information more freely
- The team develops its own identity and culture

**Project Manager Actions:**
- Encourage team decision-making within defined parameters
- Facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration
- Recognise and celebrate team achievements
- Step back from detailed direction, moving to a more supportive role
- Document lessons learned and best practices as they emerge

**Engineering Project Example:** After initial challenges, the Airbus A380 development programme established cross-functional integration teams that developed their own protocols for managing complex engineering interfaces between different manufacturing sites (Shenhar and Dvir, 2007).

### Stage 4: Performing

**Characteristics:**
- The team operates efficiently towards shared goals
- Members are competent, autonomous, and able to handle decision-making
- Disagreements occur but are resolved constructively
- The team is energised and motivated
- Focus is on task achievement and problem solving

**Project Manager Actions:**
- Delegate authority appropriately to team members
- Focus on strategic issues and stakeholder management
- Remove barriers and secure resources
- Maintain team motivation and morale
- Prepare for eventual team disbandment

**Engineering Project Example:** The Thames Tideway Tunnel project achieved performing stage when its integrated engineering teams successfully resolved complex technical challenges related to tunnel boring beneath densely populated urban areas, demonstrating high levels of technical problem-solving and collaboration (Tideway, 2020).

### Stage 5: Adjourning (or Mourning)

**Characteristics:**
- The project is completing and the team will disband
- Some members may experience anxiety about future assignments
- There may be sadness about the loss of relationships
- Focus shifts from task achievement to closure activities

**Project Manager Actions:**
- Conduct formal project closure activities
- Recognise individual and team contributions
- Facilitate knowledge transfer and lessons learned
- Assist team members with transitions to new assignments
- Conduct team celebrations and provide closure

**Engineering Project Example:** Upon completion of the London 2012 Olympic Stadium, the project team conducted extensive lessons learned sessions and team recognition events before disbanding, ensuring that valuable project knowledge was retained for future infrastructure projects (National Audit Office, 2012).

### Application to Engineering Projects

Understanding Tuckman's model helps engineering project managers to:

1. **Anticipate Challenges:** Recognise that conflict during storming is normal and temporary
2. **Time Interventions:** Know when to be directive (forming) versus supportive (norming)
3. **Accelerate Development:** Implement targeted interventions to move teams through stages faster
4. **Manage Expectations:** Help stakeholders understand that peak performance takes time to achieve
5. **Plan Resources:** Allocate time for team development activities within project schedules

It is important to note that teams may regress to earlier stages when membership changes significantly, when new technical challenges emerge, or when external pressures increase. Project managers must remain vigilant to signs of regression and intervene appropriately.

## 3.0 Team Building Skills
**Time: 12 minutes | LO2.2**

### Core Team Building Competencies

Effective team building in engineering project management requires three foundational skills: establishing rapport, active listening, and motivating team members. These skills enable project managers to create environments where technical professionals can collaborate effectively despite differences in discipline, organisation, and perspective.

---

## 3.1 Establishing Rapport
**Time: 4 minutes | LO2.2**

### Definition and Importance

Rapport refers to a harmonious relationship characterised by mutual understanding, trust, and affinity. In engineering project contexts, rapport facilitates open communication, reduces defensiveness during technical discussions, and enables difficult conversations about performance or resources.

### Techniques for Establishing Rapport

**1. Personal Connection:**
- Learn and use team members' names consistently
- Remember personal details shared (within appropriate professional boundaries)
- Acknowledge individual contributions publicly
- Show genuine interest in team members' professional development

**2. Behavioural Mirroring:**
- Adapt communication style to match individual preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Match the level of formality preferred by team members
- Respect cultural communication norms within multinational teams

**3. Demonstrating Competence:**
- Display technical understanding appropriate to the project
- Make informed decisions based on sound engineering principles
- Admit when knowledge gaps exist and seek expert input
- Follow through on commitments consistently

**4. Creating Shared Experiences:**
- Organise team meetings with social components (within reason)
- Celebrate project milestones and individual achievements
- Create opportunities for informal interaction (site visits, design reviews)
- Establish team rituals (weekly stand-ups, problem-solving sessions)

### Benefits in Engineering Projects

When project managers establish effective rapport:

- Engineers are more likely to surface technical concerns early
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration improves
- Conflict is addressed constructively rather than avoided
- Team members are more receptive to feedback and direction
- Knowledge sharing increases

### Limitations and Cautions

- Building rapport requires time investment that may seem unproductive initially
- Some team members may interpret rapport-building as favouritism
- Cultural differences affect what constitutes appropriate rapport-building behaviour
- Excessive familiarity can undermine authority when difficult decisions are required

The Association for Project Management emphasises that rapport must be balanced with professional boundaries, particularly when project managers must make unpopular resource allocation or personnel decisions (APM, 2019).

## 3.2 Active Listening Techniques
**Time: 4 minutes | LO2.2**

### The Importance of Active Listening

Active listening is a structured way of listening and responding that focuses full attention on the speaker, seeking to understand both content and emotion. For engineering project managers, active listening is critical because:

1. Technical problems are often complex and require full understanding before solutions can be proposed
2. Team members may be reluctant to share concerns about technical feasibility or risks
3. Misunderstandings in engineering specifications can have significant cost implications
4. Stakeholder requirements must be fully understood before design commences

Research by Roebuck et al. (2004) found that effective listening by project managers was positively correlated with team satisfaction and project success in technology projects.

### Active Listening Techniques

**1. Giving Full Attention:**
- Eliminate distractions (close laptop, silence phone)
- Make appropriate eye contact
- Face the speaker with open body posture
- Avoid interrupting or finishing sentences

**2. Demonstrating Engagement:**
- Use verbal encouragers ("I see," "Tell me more," "Go on")
- Nod and use facial expressions appropriately
- Take notes when discussing technical details
- Ask clarifying questions

**3. Reflecting and Paraphrasing:**
- Summarise what was said: "So what you're saying is..."
- Reflect emotions as well as content: "It sounds like you're concerned about..."
- Check understanding: "Let me make sure I understand correctly..."

**4. Avoiding Listening Barriers:**
- Don't formulate responses while the speaker is still talking
- Resist the temptation to jump to solutions prematurely
- Avoid judging or criticising during information gathering
- Don't allow personal biases to filter what is heard

**5. Responding Appropriately:**
- Acknowledge the speaker's perspective before presenting alternatives
- Ask open questions to gather more information
- Confirm actions that will be taken based on the conversation
- Follow up on commitments made during the discussion

### Application in Engineering Contexts

**Design Reviews:** Active listening helps project managers understand engineers' technical concerns about proposed solutions, even when those concerns are not articulated with perfect clarity.

**Risk Identification:** Team members are more likely to raise potential problems when they believe they will be heard without judgment.

**Stakeholder Management:** Clients and end users often struggle to articulate requirements precisely; active listening helps project managers understand underlying needs.

**Conflict Resolution:** Understanding all perspectives fully is essential before attempting to resolve disputes between team members or stakeholders.

### The Listening Hierarchy

```
LEVELS OF LISTENING IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Level 5: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
EMPATHIC │ Understanding feelings and emotions │  MOST
LISTENING│ Seeing the issue from their perspective│ EFFECTIVE
         └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                       ▲
Level 4: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
ATTENTIVE│ Listening for meaning and intent    │
LISTENING│ Asking clarifying questions          │
         └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                       ▲
Level 3: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
SELECTIVE│ Listening for specific information   │
LISTENING│ Filtering based on own agenda        │
         └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                       ▲
Level 2: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
PRETEND  │ Appearing to listen but not engaged │
LISTENING│ Thinking about own response           │
         └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                       ▲
Level 1: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
IGNORING │ Not listening at all                 │  LEAST
         │ Completely focused elsewhere          │  EFFECTIVE
         └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Engineering project managers should strive for Levels 4 and 5, moving beyond merely hearing words to understanding meaning and acknowledging emotions that may affect technical work.

## 3.3 Motivating the Project Team
**Time: 4 minutes | LO2.2**

### Understanding Motivation in Engineering Projects

Motivation refers to the internal and external factors that stimulate desire and energy in team members to be continually interested and committed to project work. In engineering projects, motivation is particularly important because:

- Technical problems require sustained intellectual effort
- Project schedules often demand extended periods of intensive work
- Team members may be juggling competing priorities from functional and project managers
- The temporary nature of projects can reduce long-term commitment

### Motivational Theories Relevant to Engineering Projects

**Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory:**

Herzberg (1968) distinguished between:

*Hygiene Factors* (that prevent dissatisfaction but don't motivate):
- Adequate resources and tools
- Fair compensation
- Safe working conditions
- Reasonable workload

*Motivators* (that drive performance):
- Achievement and recognition
- Interesting and challenging work
- Responsibility and autonomy
- Professional growth opportunities

**Application:** Engineering project managers should ensure hygiene factors are met (adequate equipment, realistic schedules) but focus motivational efforts on recognition, challenging assignments, and professional development opportunities.

**Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:**

In project contexts, this translates to:
- Physiological: Basic working conditions
- Safety: Job security, health and safety on site
- Social: Team belonging and collaborative relationships
- Esteem: Recognition and respect from peers
- Self-actualisation: Contributing to meaningful engineering achievements

**Application:** Different team members may be motivated by different levels. Graduate engineers may be motivated by learning opportunities (self-actualisation) while contractors may prioritise job security and steady work (safety needs).

### Practical Motivation Strategies

**1. Provide Clear Purpose and Vision:**
- Connect individual work to project outcomes and organisational goals
- Explain the end use and beneficiaries of the engineering project
- Share success stories and positive stakeholder feedback
- Demonstrate how the project advances engineering practice

**2. Recognise and Celebrate Achievements:**
- Acknowledge individual and team contributions publicly
- Celebrate milestone completions
- Highlight innovative solutions to technical challenges
- Provide specific, timely positive feedback

**3. Provide Autonomy Within Boundaries:**
- Allow engineers to determine how to achieve specified outcomes
- Delegate decision-making authority appropriately
- Avoid micromanagement of technical approaches
- Trust team members' professional judgment

**4. Create Development Opportunities:**
- Assign stretching but achievable challenges
- Provide access to training and professional development
- Facilitate mentoring relationships
- Support professional institution membership and progression

**5. Ensure Fairness and Transparency:**
- Make decisions based on clear, consistent criteria
- Communicate the rationale behind resource allocation decisions
- Address performance issues promptly and fairly
- Distribute workload equitably

**6. Remove Barriers:**
- Secure necessary resources and tools
- Resolve organisational obstacles
- Shield the team from unnecessary political interference
- Streamline approval processes where possible

### Demotivation Factors to Avoid

Engineering project managers must be aware of factors that rapidly demotivate technical teams:

1. **Constantly Changing Requirements:** Frequent scope changes that invalidate completed work
2. **Unclear Objectives:** Ambiguity about what success looks like
3. **Lack of Resources:** Expecting professional work without adequate tools or time
4. **Ignored Expertise:** Making technical decisions without consulting subject matter experts
5. **Unfair Treatment:** Inconsistent application of policies or visible favouritism
6. **Poor Communication:** Keeping team members uninformed about project status or decisions
7. **Unrealistic Deadlines:** Schedule pressure that forces compromise on quality

### Motivating in Challenging Circumstances

When projects face difficulties (budget cuts, schedule delays, technical problems), motivation becomes even more critical. Strategies include:

- **Increased Communication:** More frequent updates reduce uncertainty
- **Problem-Solving Involvement:** Engage team in finding solutions
- **Acknowledging Reality:** Being honest about challenges while remaining optimistic
- **Protecting the Team:** Buffering team members from organisational pressures where possible
- **Celebrating Small Wins:** Finding reasons for optimism despite setbacks

## 4.0 Conflict Management in Engineering Projects
**Time: 15 minutes | LO2.2**

### Understanding Conflict in Project Environments

Conflict is an inevitable feature of engineering project management. When managed constructively, conflict can lead to better technical solutions, more robust risk identification, and improved team performance. When managed poorly, conflict derails projects, damages relationships, and wastes resources.

Conflict in engineering projects differs from conflicts in stable organisational environments because:

1. **Time Pressure:** Project deadlines create urgency that intensifies disagreements
2. **Resource Constraints:** Competition for limited resources generates conflict
3. **Technical Disagreements:** Multiple valid approaches to engineering problems create tension
4. **Organisational Complexity:** Matrix structures create conflicting loyalties
5. **High Stakes:** Significant costs and reputational risks amplify the consequences of decisions

---

## 4.1 Sources and Types of Conflict
**Time: 5 minutes | LO2.2**

### Common Sources of Conflict in Engineering Projects

**1. Technical Disagreements:**
- Debates about design approaches or technical standards
- Differing interpretations of specifications or requirements
- Disputes about testing protocols or acceptance criteria
- Conflicting engineering philosophies or methodologies

*Example:* On the Airbus A380 project, engineering teams in different countries specified electrical wiring harnesses using incompatible CAD systems, creating significant conflict about responsibility for redesign costs (Shenhar and Dvir, 2007).

**2. Resource Allocation:**
- Competition for skilled personnel
- Disagreements about budget allocation between work packages
- Disputes over equipment, facilities, or materials
- Conflicts about shared resources between concurrent projects

**3. Schedule Pressures:**
- Disagreements about realistic task durations
- Conflicts about activity sequencing and dependencies
- Disputes over schedule compression methods
- Trade-offs between speed and quality

**4. Roles and Responsibilities:**
- Unclear accountability for deliverables
- Interface conflicts between different disciplines
- Matrix management conflicts (functional versus project authority)
- Scope boundary disputes between contractors

**5. Interpersonal Factors:**
- Personality clashes between team members
- Communication style differences
- Cultural or generational differences
- Historical conflicts from previous projects

**6. Stakeholder Priorities:**
- Competing objectives between project sponsor and end users
- Conflicts between project goals and organisational policies
- Disagreements about trade-offs between cost, time, and quality
- Disputes with regulatory authorities or community stakeholders

### Types of Conflict

**Constructive Conflict:**
- Focuses on issues rather than personalities
- Generates multiple alternatives for consideration
- Leads to better understanding of trade-offs
- Strengthens commitment to final decisions

**Destructive Conflict:**
- Becomes personal and emotional
- Leads to win-lose thinking
- Damages relationships and trust
- Reduces team productivity and morale

The project manager's role is to foster constructive conflict while preventing or resolving destructive conflict.

## 4.2 Conflict Management Strategies
**Time: 6 minutes | LO2.2**

### The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument

Thomas and Kilmann (1974) identified five conflict management strategies based on two dimensions: assertiveness (pursuing one's own concerns) and cooperativeness (satisfying others' concerns).

```

```

### Strategy 1: Competing (Forcing)

**When to Use:**
- Emergency situations requiring immediate decisions
- Critical safety issues that cannot be compromised
- When the project manager has clear authority and responsibility
- When quick, decisive action is essential
- When unpopular decisions must be implemented

**Advantages:**
- Provides quick resolution
- Demonstrates leadership in crisis
- Appropriate when one party has superior expertise or authority

**Disadvantages:**
- Damages relationships and trust
- Creates resentment and reduces future cooperation
- May miss important information held by others
- Winners and losers reduce collaboration

**Engineering Project Example:** When safety concerns arise on a construction site, the project manager must use competing strategy to halt dangerous work immediately, regardless of schedule or cost implications.

### Strategy 2: Collaborating (Problem-Solving)

**When to Use:**
- Both parties' concerns are too important to compromise
- Time is available for thorough discussion
- Building consensus and commitment is important
- Learning and relationship-building are valued
- Complex technical issues require multiple perspectives

**Advantages:**
- Produces optimal solutions that satisfy all parties
- Builds commitment to implementation
- Strengthens relationships and trust
- Encourages innovation and creative problem-solving

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming and resource-intensive
- Requires skilled facilitation
- May not be possible if trust is lacking
- Can be exhausting for participants

**Engineering Project Example:** When mechanical and electrical engineering teams disagree about equipment placement in a plant design, collaboration allows exploration of multiple configurations that optimise both disciplines' requirements.

### Strategy 3: Compromising

**When to Use:**
- Quick resolution is needed but not at any cost
- Goals are moderately important but not worth disrupting relationships
- Collaboration has failed or time ran out
- Temporary solutions are acceptable
- Parties have roughly equal power

**Advantages:**
- Faster than collaboration
- Preserves working relationships
- Allows partial satisfaction for both parties
- Demonstrates fairness and pragmatism

**Disadvantages:**
- Neither party fully satisfied
- May produce suboptimal technical solutions
- Can become habitual, missing collaboration opportunities
- May not address underlying issues

**Engineering Project Example:** When budget constraints require scope reduction, the project manager might compromise by deferring some deliverables to a later phase rather than eliminating them entirely, partially satisfying both sponsor and technical team concerns.

### Strategy 4: Avoiding (Withdrawal)

**When to Use:**
- The issue is trivial or symptomatic of larger problems
- Cooling-off period needed before productive discussion
- More information required before addressing the issue
- Other more pressing matters require attention
- Cost of conflict exceeds potential benefits

**Advantages:**
- Allows time for tensions to reduce
- Appropriate when others can resolve issue more effectively
- Preserves resources for more important conflicts
- Sometimes problems resolve themselves

**Disadvantages:**
- Issues may escalate if not addressed
- Can be perceived as weak leadership
- Important concerns may go unaddressed
- Frustration builds in those seeking resolution

**Engineering Project Example:** When two junior engineers disagree about documentation formatting standards, the project manager might avoid direct intervention, allowing them to work it out themselves unless it impacts project deliverables.

### Strategy 5: Accommodating (Smoothing)

**When to Use:**
- Maintaining the relationship is more important than the issue
- The project manager realizes they were wrong
- Building social capital for future important issues
- The issue is much more important to the other party
- Minimising damage when you will not prevail anyway

**Advantages:**
- Preserves relationships
- Demonstrates flexibility and goodwill
- Encourages reciprocity in future conflicts
- Appropriate when others have expertise

**Disadvantages:**
- One's own legitimate concerns go unmet
- Can be perceived as weakness
- May encourage future unreasonable demands
- Can lead to suboptimal technical solutions

**Engineering Project Example:** When a key stakeholder insists on a particular reporting format that has little technical impact, the project manager may accommodate this preference to maintain the relationship for more significant issues.

### Selecting the Appropriate Strategy

The choice of conflict management strategy should consider:

1. **Issue Importance:** How critical is this issue to project success?
2. **Relationship Importance:** How important is maintaining this relationship?
3. **Time Available:** How urgent is resolution?
4. **Power Dynamics:** What is the relative authority of the parties?
5. **Desired Outcomes:** Is commitment to implementation critical?
6. **Resources Available:** How much time and energy can be invested?

Effective engineering project managers develop flexibility in using all five strategies appropriately rather than defaulting to a single preferred style.

## 4.3 Managing Competing Priorities and Resources
**Time: 4 minutes | LO2.2**

### The Challenge of Resource Competition

Engineering projects rarely have unlimited resources. Project managers must navigate competition for:

- **Skilled Personnel:** Specialists in high demand across multiple projects
- **Equipment:** Testing facilities, machinery, computing resources
- **Budget:** Funding allocated across work packages and contingencies
- **Time:** Schedule constraints limiting activity durations
- **Facilities:** Laboratory space, office accommodation, construction areas

### Strategies for Managing Resource Conflicts

**1. Transparent Allocation Criteria:**

Establish and communicate clear principles for resource decisions:
- Project priority within the portfolio
- Critical path considerations
- Resource utilisation efficiency
- Technical dependencies
- Risk mitigation requirements

**2. Advance Planning:**
- Use resource histograms to visualise demand
- Identify resource conflicts early in planning
- Build resource buffers for high-demand specialties
- Negotiate resource commitments with functional managers during project initiation

**3. Resource Levelling and Smoothing:**
- Adjust non-critical activities to reduce peak demand
- Redistribute work within available float time
- Consider activity splitting where appropriate
- Balance resource utilisation across project duration

**4. Negotiation with Stakeholders:**
- Present resource requests with clear justification
- Offer alternatives when first choice unavailable
- Build reciprocal relationships with resource providers
- Escalate to project sponsor when necessary

**5. Creative Solutions:**
- Investigate hiring contractors or consultants
- Consider training to develop internal capabilities
- Explore equipment rental or sharing arrangements
- Investigate outsourcing of non-critical activities

### Managing Tension Within and Between Teams

**Internal Team Tension:**

Common sources include:
- Workload imbalances
- Perceived favouritism
- Personality conflicts
- Stress from project pressures

Management approaches:
- Regular one-to-one meetings to surface concerns
- Fair distribution of interesting and routine work
- Explicit recognition of contributions
- Timely intervention in interpersonal conflicts

**Inter-Team Tension:**

Common sources include:
- Interface ambiguities
- Sequential dependencies causing blame
- Competition for shared resources
- Different organisational cultures

Management approaches:
- Clear interface agreements documented early
- Regular coordination meetings
- Joint problem-solving sessions
- Escalation protocols for unresolved issues

**Stakeholder Tensions:**

Common sources include:
- Conflicting success criteria
- Communication gaps
- Unrealistic expectations
- Cost-schedule-quality trade-offs

Management approaches:
- Stakeholder analysis and management strategies
- Regular stakeholder engagement
- Transparent reporting of project status
- Early warning of problems with proposed solutions

### Case Study: Resource Conflict Resolution

**Scenario:** On a manufacturing automation project, both the robotics engineering team and the control systems team require the same senior electrical engineer for three overlapping weeks. Both activities are on or near the critical path.

**Analysis:**
- Issue importance: HIGH (affects critical path)
- Relationship importance: HIGH (need continued cooperation)
- Time available: LIMITED (work must proceed soon)
- Power dynamics: EQUAL (both team leaders have legitimate needs)

**Appropriate Strategy: Collaboration**

**Process:**
1. Joint meeting with both team leaders and the electrical engineer
2. Detailed review of specific tasks requiring the specialist
3. Investigation of whether tasks can be:
   - Sequenced (do one then the other)
   - Split (engineer divides time between teams)
   - Delegated (junior engineers handle some work with oversight)
   - Outsourced (bring in contractor for one team)

**Resolution:** After collaborative discussion, the team:
- Identified that 40% of control systems work could be delegated to a qualified junior engineer with daily oversight
- Agreed the electrical engineer would focus on robotics for two weeks, then transfer to control systems for one week
- Established daily coordination calls to handle interface questions
- Both teams committed to this plan and worked to make it successful

This collaborative approach maintained relationships, optimized use of the scarce resource, and created commitment to making the solution work.

## 5.0 Consequences of Poor Team Building and Conflict Management
**Time: 5 minutes | LO2.2**

### Impact on Project Outcomes

When engineering project managers lack effective team building and conflict management skills, projects suffer multiple consequences:

### 1. Schedule Delays

**Manifestations:**
- Decisions delayed while conflicts remain unresolved
- Rework required due to miscommunication
- Lost productivity as team members avoid collaboration
- Escalations consuming management time

**Example:** The Heathrow Terminal 5 baggage handling system failed dramatically at opening because poor integration between systems engineering teams led to inadequate testing of interfaces. The root cause was inadequate coordination and unresolved conflicts about interface responsibilities (Brady and Davies, 2014).

### 2. Cost Overruns

**Manifestations:**
- Inefficient resource utilisation
- Duplicate efforts due to poor communication
- Errors requiring costly correction
- Turnover requiring recruitment and training
- Claims and disputes with contractors

**Example:** The Sydney Opera House project experienced cost overruns exceeding 1,400% of original estimates, partly due to conflicts between the architect and structural engineers that led to design rework and construction delays (Murray, 2004).

### 3. Quality Degradation

**Manifestations:**
- Technical shortcuts taken under pressure
- Inadequate peer review due to poor relationships
- Information hoarding rather than sharing
- Lack of challenge to poor decisions (groupthink)
- Acceptance of substandard work to avoid conflict

### 4. Team Dysfunction

**Manifestations:**
- High turnover and difficulty retaining talent
- Low morale and motivation
- Passive-aggressive behaviour
- Blame culture rather than problem-solving focus
- Knowledge silos and poor collaboration

### 5. Stakeholder Dissatisfaction

**Manifestations:**
- Loss of confidence in project management
- Reduced support for project decisions
- Withholding of resources or approvals
- Negative reputation affecting future projects
- Contract disputes and legal action

### 6. Personal and Organisational Impacts

**For the Project Manager:**
- Stress and burnout
- Damage to professional reputation
- Limited career progression
- Loss of future opportunities

**For the Organisation:**
- Reduced project success rates
- Difficulty attracting talent
- Loss of competitive advantage
- Diminished organisational learning

### Recommendations for Improvement

When team building or conflict management problems are identified, project managers should:

**1. Seek Training and Development:**
- Attend workshops on team dynamics and conflict resolution
- Pursue professional development in leadership and communication
- Obtain coaching or mentoring from experienced project managers
- Study case examples of effective team building

**2. Implement Structured Approaches:**
- Use formal team building activities at project inception
- Establish clear team norms and ground rules
- Implement regular retrospectives to surface issues early
- Create transparent decision-making processes

**3. Enhance Communication:**
- Increase frequency and quality of team meetings
- Establish multiple communication channels
- Implement collaborative tools (shared workspaces, project management software)
- Over-communicate during periods of uncertainty

**4. Build Self-Awareness:**
- Understand personal conflict management style preferences
- Recognise own triggers and biases
- Develop emotional intelligence capabilities
- Seek feedback on leadership effectiveness

**5. Leverage Organisational Resources:**
- Engage human resources for serious interpersonal conflicts
- Utilise mediation services when appropriate
- Access organisational development expertise
- Learn from lessons learned databases

**6. Focus on Prevention:**
- Invest time in team building during project forming stage
- Address small conflicts before they escalate
- Build strong relationships during calm periods
- Establish trust through consistent, fair behaviour

The Project Management Institute emphasises that developing competencies in team building and conflict management should be a continuous professional development priority for all project managers (PMI, 2017).

## 7.0 Conclusion and Key Takeaways
**Time: Included in workshop closing | LO2.2**

### Summary of Key Concepts

This lecture has explored two critical competencies for engineering project managers: team building and conflict management. These interpersonal skills are as essential to project success as technical knowledge and planning expertise.

**Team Building:**
- Understanding team development through Tuckman's five-stage model enables appropriate leadership interventions
- Establishing rapport creates the foundation for effective collaboration
- Active listening ensures project managers fully understand technical concerns and human issues
- Motivation strategies must address both hygiene factors and true motivators

**Conflict Management:**
- Conflict in engineering projects is inevitable and can be constructive when managed well
- Understanding sources of conflict enables proactive prevention
- Five conflict management strategies (competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding, accommodating) each have appropriate applications
- Managing resource competition and stakeholder tensions requires transparency and skilled negotiation

**Consequences:**
- Poor team building and conflict management directly impact schedule, cost, quality, and stakeholder satisfaction
- Project managers must continuously develop these competencies through training, practice, and reflection

### Application to Assessment

In the external examination, learners should be prepared to:

1. **Explain** Tuckman's model and identify team development stages in scenarios
2. **Describe** team building techniques and when each is most appropriate
3. **Analyse** conflict situations and recommend appropriate management strategies
4. **Evaluate** the consequences of poor team building or conflict management
5. **Recommend** courses of action to improve team effectiveness in given scenarios

### Professional Development

As learners progress in their engineering careers, developing strong team building and conflict management skills will:

- Enhance technical contributions through better collaboration
- Increase leadership opportunities
- Improve project success rates
- Build professional reputation and career progression
- Enable contribution to more complex and impactful engineering projects

The most successful engineering project managers combine technical expertise with highly developed interpersonal skills, recognising that engineering projects are delivered by people, not just technical systems.
