### Learning Outcome
LO2.2 - Understanding personal preferences in team building and conflict management to develop self-awareness as a project manager.

### Objectives
- Identify personal team role preferences
- Recognise default conflict management style
- Understand implications for project management effectiveness

### Instructions

**Part A: Team Role Preferences (3 minutes)**

Consider your behaviour in team situations. For each statement below, rate yourself on a scale of 1-5:
- 1 = Not like me at all
- 3 = Somewhat like me
- 5 = Very much like me

**Team Role Assessment:**

1. I enjoy generating creative ideas and innovative approaches to problems. ___
2. I prefer to coordinate team activities and ensure everyone contributes. ___
3. I like to analyse situations thoroughly before making decisions. ___
4. I focus on ensuring tasks are completed accurately and on time. ___
5. I excel at building relationships and resolving team conflicts. ___
6. I enjoy challenging the status quo and questioning assumptions. ___
7. I am good at finding resources and building external networks. ___
8. I prefer to drive action and push through obstacles to achieve results. ___

**Scoring Guide:**
- Statements 1 & 6: Creative/Challenger roles
- Statements 2 & 5: Coordinator/Team-builder roles
- Statements 3 & 7: Analyst/Networker roles
- Statements 4 & 8: Implementer/Driver roles

**Part B: Conflict Style Tendencies (3 minutes)**

In conflict situations on engineering projects, which approach do you typically use first?

Rank these five approaches from 1 (most like you) to 5 (least like you):

___ **Competing:** I pursue my concerns assertively, sometimes at others' expense  
___ **Collaborating:** I work with others to find solutions that fully satisfy everyone  
___ **Compromising:** I look for middle-ground solutions that partially satisfy both sides  
___ **Avoiding:** I tend to diplomatically sidestep issues or postpone addressing them  
___ **Accommodating:** I yield to others' wishes to maintain harmony  

**Part C: Reflection (2 minutes)**

Write brief notes on:

1. **Strengths:** Based on your self-assessment, what team building or conflict management strengths might you bring to an engineering project?

   _________________________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________________________

2. **Development Areas:** What skills from today's lecture would be most valuable for you to develop?

   _________________________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________________________

3. **Situational Awareness:** Can you think of situations where your natural preferences might be less effective?

   _________________________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________________________

### Helpful Hints

- Be honest in your self-assessment; this is for your own development
- No style is inherently better than others; effectiveness depends on the situation
- Most people have a dominant style but should develop flexibility across all five
- Engineering project managers benefit from understanding their natural tendencies to consciously adapt when needed

## Activity 2: Identifying Team Development Stages
**Duration: 7 minutes | Individual Work**

### Learning Outcome
LO2.2 - Applying Tuckman's model to recognise team development stages in engineering project scenarios.

### Objectives
- Identify behaviours characteristic of each stage of Tuckman's model
- Recommend appropriate project manager interventions for each stage
- Understand progression through team development stages

### Scenario Context

You are the project manager for an automated warehouse systems integration project involving mechanical engineers, software developers, robotics specialists, and logistics experts from three different companies. The project will last 18 months.

### Instructions

Read each scenario below and:
1. Identify which stage of Tuckman's model is being described (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, or Adjourning)
2. Recommend one specific action the project manager should take
3. Explain your reasoning briefly

**Scenario A:**

The project team has been working together for three months. Yesterday's design review meeting became heated when the software team criticised the mechanical engineers' approach to sensor placement. The robotics specialists sided with the software team, while the logistics experts stayed silent. After the meeting, the mechanical engineering lead questioned your competence as project manager in an email copied to your project sponsor.

---

**Scenario B:**

The team completed its first successful integration test yesterday. Team members are now proactively sharing information across disciplines without being asked. The software developers have begun informally reviewing mechanical drawings to identify potential integration issues early. Weekly team meetings are productive, with everyone contributing ideas. Team members have established informal communication channels and even socialise occasionally.

**Stage Identified:** _______________________

**Recommended PM Action:**

**Scenario C:**

It's the project kick-off meeting. Team members are introducing themselves and listening politely to the project overview. People are formal and professional but asking few questions. The mechanical engineers are sitting together on one side of the room, while the software team occupies the other side. Everyone is looking at you expectantly whenever decisions are needed.

**Scenario D:**

The warehouse system went live two weeks ago and is operating successfully. The project sponsor has officially accepted all deliverables. Tomorrow is the team's final lessons learned workshop before everyone returns to their home organisations. Some team members have expressed sadness about the team disbanding, particularly those from the same company who enjoyed working together.

### Helpful Hints

- Consider the specific behaviours described in each scenario
- Remember that conflict in Stage 2 (Storming) is normal and expected
- Think about whether the project manager should be more directive or more supportive
- Consider both task-focused and relationship-focused interventions
- Teams can regress to earlier stages if circumstances change significantly

---

## Activity 3: Conflict Resolution Strategy Selection
**Duration: 12 minutes | Individual Work**

### Learning Outcome
LO2.2 - Applying conflict management strategies appropriately to engineering project scenarios.

### Objectives
- Analyse conflict situations systematically
- Select appropriate conflict management strategies with justification
- Evaluate consequences of different approaches
- Recommend specific courses of action

### Instructions

Read each conflict scenario carefully. For each one:
1. Identify the source and type of conflict
2. Select the most appropriate conflict management strategy (Competing, Collaborating, Compromising, Avoiding, or Accommodating)
3. Justify your selection based on the specific circumstances
4. Describe the specific actions you would take as project manager
5. Consider potential consequences of your approach

---

### Scenario 1: The Safety Dispute

**Context:** You are managing the construction of an offshore wind turbine installation vessel. The project is currently two weeks ahead of schedule and within budget.

**Situation:** During yesterday's site inspection, you observed crane operators not wearing the specified fall protection equipment when working at heights. The site supervisor (who reports to the main contractor, not to you) explained that the equipment slows down operations and "we've never had an accident in 20 years." Your health and safety advisor insists this is a serious violation of safety regulations and contract requirements.

### Scenario 2: The Resource Allocation Conflict

**Context:** You are project manager for developing a new automotive engine management system. The project has moderate schedule pressure and normal budget constraints.

**Situation:** Your chief electrical engineer (Sarah) and lead software developer (James) both need access to the prototype test vehicle for the next two weeks. Sarah needs it to validate sensor integration, while James needs it to test control algorithms. Both activities are moderately important to project progress but neither is on the critical path. There is some float time available, but both engineers have other commitments later that would make postponement inconvenient. Both have submitted reasonable technical arguments for priority.

### Scenario 3: The Technical Disagreement

**Context:** You are managing a clean water treatment plant project. The design is in final stages before construction bidding begins. The project has tight timelines and limited contingency budget.

**Situation:** Your senior civil engineer and senior chemical engineer have a fundamental disagreement about the filtration system design. The civil engineer advocates for a conventional sand filtration approach (proven technology, lower risk, slightly higher ongoing costs). The chemical engineer strongly supports a new membrane filtration system (innovative, lower operating costs, higher initial investment, less proven at this scale). Both engineers have refused to compromise and have each threatened to remove their names from the design if the other's approach is selected. The client has expressed no strong preference. Each approach meets technical requirements but with different risk-cost profiles.

**Your Analysis:**

**Source of Conflict:** 

_________________________________________________________________________

**Type of Conflict:** (Technical / Resource / Schedule / Role / Interpersonal / Stakeholder)

### Scenario 4: The Documentation Format Dispute

**Context:** You are managing a pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment project with substantial quality and regulatory compliance requirements.

**Situation:** Two junior mechanical engineers have spent the past week arguing about the format for technical documentation. One wants to use a particular CAD software's native format; the other insists on converting everything to PDF for consistency. Both have sent you emails with detailed arguments. The project has no specific requirement for documentation format, and either approach would be acceptable. The argument is becoming personal, with each engineer questioning the other's professionalism. More senior team members are rolling their eyes at the whole situation.

**Your Analysis:**

**Source of Conflict:** 

_________________________________________________________________________

**Type of Conflict:** (Technical / Resource / Schedule / Role / Interpersonal / Stakeholder)

### Helpful Hints

**Analysing Conflicts:**
- Consider the importance of the issue to project success
- Evaluate the importance of maintaining working relationships
- Assess time pressure for resolution
- Consider power dynamics and authority levels
- Think about whether commitment to implementation is critical

**Safety Issues:**
- Safety concerns always take priority over schedule and cost
- Non-negotiable issues require competing strategy
- Documentation and communication are essential

**Resource Conflicts:**
- Look for creative solutions that satisfy both parties
- Consider whether collaboration time investment is worthwhile
- Compromise may be appropriate when neither activity is critical

**Technical Disagreements:**
- Engineering decisions should be based on objective criteria
- Involve stakeholders in decisions that affect them
- Consider risk, cost, and benefit systematically
- Document rationale for decisions

**Minor Disputes:**
- Not every conflict requires direct intervention
- Sometimes avoiding allows resolution without management involvement
- Set boundaries on acceptable behaviour even for minor issues

---

## Closing Discussion
**Duration: 3 minutes | Whole Class**

### Facilitated Reflection

The lecturer facilitates a brief whole-class discussion covering:

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. **Self-Awareness:** "What did you learn about your own team building or conflict management preferences?"

2. **Situational Factors:** "What factors influenced your choice of conflict management strategy in Activity 3?"

3. **Real-World Application:** "How might you apply today's concepts in your current or future engineering projects?"

4. **Challenges:** "What do you think will be most challenging about managing team dynamics and conflicts in real engineering projects?"

### Key Takeaways (Lecturer Summary)

The lecturer should emphasise:

1. **No One Right Answer:** Different conflict management strategies are appropriate in different circumstances. Effectiveness depends on the specific situation.

2. **Self-Awareness Is Critical:** Understanding your natural preferences is the first step to developing flexibility and choosing appropriate responses.

3. **Tuckman's Model Provides Framework:** Recognising team development stages helps project managers understand that some behaviours (like conflict in storming) are normal and temporary.

4. **Skills Can Be Developed:** Team building and conflict management are learnable skills that improve with practice and reflection.

5. **Safety Is Non-Negotiable:** Some issues (particularly safety) require competing strategy regardless of relationship implications.

6. **Prevention Is Better Than Cure:** Investing in team building during the forming stage prevents many conflicts from developing.

### Link to Assessment

Remind learners that the external examination will include scenario-based questions requiring them to:
- Identify team development stages
- Recommend appropriate project manager actions
- Analyse conflicts and justify resolution strategies
- Evaluate consequences of poor team building or conflict management

---

## Solution Guide and Teaching Notes

### Activity 1: Self-Assessment - Guidance

**Purpose:**
This activity builds self-awareness, which is foundational for developing flexibility in team building and conflict management approaches.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Most learners will discover they have a dominant team role preference and conflict style
- Discussion should emphasise that all styles have value in appropriate situations
- Encourage learners to develop flexibility rather than rigidly adhering to natural preferences

**Teaching Points:**
- No single "best" style exists; effectiveness is situational
- Project managers benefit from adapting their approach to circumstances
- Self-awareness helps project managers recognise when they might be defaulting to comfortable but ineffective approaches

**Common Issues:**
- Some learners may mark themselves highly on everything (social desirability bias)
- Others may be overly self-critical
- Emphasise this is developmental tool, not a test

**Extension:**
- Discuss how different team roles complement each other
- Consider how cultural backgrounds influence conflict style preferences
- Relate findings to Belbin's team roles or other models if learners are familiar

---

### Activity 2: Team Development Stages - Model Answers

**Scenario A Answer:**

**Stage:** Storming

**Recommended PM Action:**
- Remain calm and objective; acknowledge that disagreement is normal and healthy at this stage
- Schedule a facilitated meeting with both engineering teams to explore technical issues objectively
- Focus discussion on project objectives and engineering criteria rather than personal positions
- Make a clear decision once all technical perspectives have been heard, documenting rationale
- Separately address the inappropriate email to sponsor, reinforcing communication protocols

**Reasoning:**
This scenario exhibits classic storming behaviours: competition for position, direct challenges to authority, faction formation, and conflict about technical approaches. The project manager should expect this phase, facilitate constructive debate about the technical issues, but maintain clear authority and professional standards. Avoiding the conflict would allow it to fester; competing might win the battle but damage relationships needed for future cooperation; collaboration on the technical issue while being directive about appropriate behaviour is appropriate.

**Teaching Point:**
Storming is uncomfortable but necessary. Project managers who suppress conflict in this stage prevent the team from reaching norming and performing. The goal is to channel conflict into constructive technical debate rather than personal antagonism.

---

**Scenario B Answer:**

**Stage:** Performing

**Recommended PM Action:**
- Step back from detailed direction and allow the team to operate autonomously
- Focus on strategic issues, stakeholder management, and removing organisational barriers
- Recognise team achievements and individual contributions
- Maintain motivation by articulating the project's importance and progress
- Begin planning for eventual team transition to other projects (looking ahead to adjourning)

**Reasoning:**
The scenario describes high-functioning team behaviours: proactive information sharing, cross-functional collaboration, productive meetings, and informal social bonds. The team has progressed through earlier stages and reached performing. Excessive manager intervention would be counterproductive. The project manager should focus on maintaining conditions that allow continued high performance.

**Teaching Point:**
Project managers sometimes struggle to delegate authority when teams reach performing stage, particularly if they have technical expertise. Micromanaging a performing team demotivates members and wastes management capacity that should focus on strategic issues.

---

**Scenario C Answer:**

**Stage:** Forming

**Recommended PM Action:**
- Clearly communicate project objectives, scope, deliverables, and success criteria
- Define roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships (RACI matrix useful here)
- Establish communication protocols, meeting schedules, and decision-making processes
- Facilitate introductions and initial relationship building (consider team-building activities)
- Set clear expectations for professional behaviour and performance standards
- Be directive and answer questions patiently; team needs structure at this stage

**Reasoning:**
The scenario shows typical forming behaviours: politeness, formality, uncertainty about roles, segregation by functional group, dependence on project manager for direction. This is entirely normal at project inception. The project manager must provide structure, clarity, and direction to help the team move efficiently toward storming (where real work and creative tension begin).

**Teaching Point:**
Time invested in clear communication and relationship building during forming accelerates progress through subsequent stages and prevents serious problems later. Rushing through forming leads to ambiguity that generates unnecessary conflict.

---

**Scenario D Answer:**

**Stage:** Adjourning (also called Mourning)

**Recommended PM Action:**
- Conduct formal project closure activities (final report, acceptance documentation)
- Facilitate comprehensive lessons learned session to capture project knowledge
- Recognise individual and team contributions (celebration, certificates, formal recognition)
- Assist team members with transition to new assignments
- Archive project documentation appropriately
- Allow time for team members to express feelings about project completion

**Reasoning:**
The scenario describes project completion and team disbandment. Some members experience genuine sadness about losing relationships formed during intensive collaboration. Tuckman later added this stage (originally only four stages) because team dissolution has predictable characteristics requiring specific management actions. Proper closure benefits individuals, captures organisational learning, and maintains relationships for potential future projects.

**Teaching Point:**
Many project managers neglect adjourning stage, allowing teams to simply dissolve without formal closure. This loses valuable lessons learned, may leave team members feeling unappreciated, and fails to provide psychological closure. Professional project management includes proper endings, not just good beginnings and middles.

---

### Activity 3: Conflict Resolution - Model Answers

**Scenario 1: Safety Dispute**

**Source of Conflict:**
Disagreement between safety compliance requirements and operational efficiency/schedule pressure.

**Type of Conflict:**
Stakeholder conflict (site supervisor vs. safety advisor), with technical and policy dimensions. Also involves interpretation of role responsibilities and contract compliance.

**Most Appropriate Strategy:**
**Competing** (forcing immediate compliance)

**Justification:**
Safety issues are non-negotiable. The site supervisor's argument about historical accident-free record is logically flawed (absence of past accidents does not guarantee future safety). Regulations exist for good reasons, contract requirements are clear, and the project manager has both legal and ethical responsibility for worker safety. The argument about efficiency is irrelevant when safety is compromised. While this will likely damage the relationship with the site supervisor temporarily, worker safety takes absolute priority.

**Specific Actions:**
1. Immediately halt all work at height until proper fall protection equipment is used correctly
2. Issue formal written notice to the main contractor documenting the safety violation and corrective action required
3. Verify contractor's safety procedures and training records; require additional training if needed
4. Inform project sponsor of safety issue and actions taken
5. Implement increased safety inspections until confidence in compliance is restored
6. Meet with site supervisor to clarify non-negotiable nature of safety requirements while maintaining professional respect

**Potential Consequences:**

*Positive:*
- Worker safety is protected (primary responsibility)
- Regulatory and contract compliance maintained
- Demonstrates strong project management leadership
- Sets clear precedent that safety is not negotiable
- Reduces project liability risk
- May prevent serious injury or fatality

*Negative:*
- Relationship with site supervisor temporarily damaged
- Possible short-term schedule impact (likely minimal)
- Contractor may be defensive or resentful
- May need to escalate to contractor's management if site supervisor resists

**Teaching Points:**
- Some issues are not appropriate for negotiation or compromise
- Project managers have legal and ethical duties that supersede relationship concerns
- Safety decisions should be documented thoroughly
- The competing strategy should be used decisively but professionally, without personal attacks
- Be prepared to escalate if compliance is not achieved

---

**Scenario 2: Resource Allocation Conflict**

**Source of Conflict:**
Competition for limited resource (test vehicle) between two equally legitimate needs.

**Type of Conflict:**
Resource allocation conflict with schedule dimensions.

**Most Appropriate Strategy:**
**Collaborating** (with Compromising as backup if collaboration fails quickly)

**Justification:**
Both activities are moderately important with some flexibility (neither on critical path, float time exists). Both engineers have legitimate technical needs. The relationship between these senior engineers is important for continued project cooperation. Time is available to explore creative solutions. Collaboration may reveal options not initially apparent (e.g., sequencing some tests, sharing vehicle time with daily coordination, identifying alternative test equipment). If collaboration produces an elegant solution, both parties will be satisfied and committed to making it work. However, if collaboration proves time-consuming or unproductive, compromise (splitting time) is acceptable fallback.

**Specific Actions:**
1. Schedule a joint meeting with both engineers (within 1-2 days)
2. Ask each to present detailed test plans showing specific vehicle requirements
3. Facilitate brainstorming of alternatives:
   - Can sensor validation and algorithm testing be coordinated so vehicle is shared?
   - Could one set of tests be conducted first with the other following immediately?
   - Is additional test equipment available that would reduce vehicle dependency?
   - Can some tests be conducted in simulation rather than with physical vehicle?
4. If collaborative solution emerges, document agreement and have both engineers commit
5. If collaboration reaches impasse after reasonable effort (2-3 hours), propose compromise: alternate days or split weeks
6. Establish coordination mechanism (daily stand-up) to manage shared resource

**Potential Consequences:**

*Positive:*
- May discover innovative solution that fully satisfies both parties
- Strengthens working relationship between engineers through problem-solving together
- Demonstrates trust in team's ability to solve problems
- Creates commitment to solution because engineers participated in creating it
- Models collaborative problem-solving for team
- May reveal other potential resource conflicts early

*Negative:*
- Requires time investment (meeting, discussion)
- Solution may be more complex than simple directive
- Both parties must be willing to engage constructively
- Risk that collaboration fails, requiring fallback to compromise anyway

**Teaching Points:**
- Collaboration is ideal when time is available and relationships matter
- Project manager should facilitate rather than dictate solution
- Creative solutions often emerge when experts problem-solve together
- Balance time invested in collaboration against issue importance
- Have a backup strategy (compromise) if collaboration proves unproductive

---

**Scenario 3: Technical Disagreement**

**Source of Conflict:**
Fundamental technical disagreement about design approach with significant risk and cost implications.

**Type of Conflict:**
Technical disagreement with stakeholder, risk, and professional reputation dimensions.

**Most Appropriate Strategy:**
**Competing** (making an informed decision based on objective criteria)

**Note:** This is competing in the sense of "project manager makes the decision," not competing in the sense of "project manager imposes personal preference." The decision should be made collaboratively with stakeholder input but ultimately requires clear leadership.

**Justification:**
Both approaches have merit, creating a genuine engineering trade-off decision. The engineers have polarised and refused to compromise, making collaboration impossible at this stage. The project cannot proceed without a decision. The tight timeline and limited contingency suggest risk management is critical. The project manager must make an informed decision using objective criteria, consulting with stakeholders (particularly the client regarding risk tolerance and whole-life costs), then communicate the decision clearly with rationale. This requires decisive leadership while respecting both engineers' expertise.

**Alternative Perspective:** Some might argue for **Compromising** (selecting a hybrid approach) or **Collaborating** (one more attempt with external facilitator). However, the engineers' refusal to compromise and threat to withdraw suggests these approaches have been exhausted.

**Specific Actions:**
1. Thank both engineers for their technical input and acknowledge both approaches have merit
2. Request each engineer to provide objective analysis addressing:
   - Capital cost (detailed bill of quantities)
   - Operational cost (20-year whole-life costs)
   - Risk analysis (probability of technical problems, commissioning timeline risk)
   - Performance comparison (treatment capacity, quality, reliability)
   - References from similar installations
3. Consult with client about:
   - Risk tolerance (proven vs. innovative technology)
   - Budget priorities (capital vs. operational cost trade-off)
   - Timeline flexibility
4. Seek independent third opinion from industry expert or professional institution if needed
5. Make decision based on objective criteria and client priorities
6. Document decision rationale thoroughly
7. Communicate decision to both engineers professionally, acknowledging their expertise
8. Make clear expectation that both will support implementation professionally
9. Meet individually with each engineer to address any lingering concerns
10. If either engineer truly cannot professionally support the decision, escalate to their functional manager

**Potential Consequences:**

*Positive:*
- Project can proceed (decision made)
- Demonstrates decisive leadership when needed
- Decision based on objective criteria (defensible)
- Client involved in decision (stakeholder management)
- Documentation protects project manager and organisation
- Sets precedent that professional behaviour expected even in disagreement

*Negative:*
- One engineer will be disappointed (relationship potentially damaged)
- Risk that disappointed engineer disengages or undermines decision
- Possibility that wrong technical choice made (inherent in any decision with uncertainty)
- If chosen approach fails, disappointed engineer may say "I told you so"
- May require difficult conversation or escalation if engineer refuses to proceed professionally

**Teaching Points:**
- Some engineering decisions do not have objectively "right" answers; they involve trade-offs
- When experts disagree fundamentally, project manager must make informed decision
- Decisions should be based on objective criteria and stakeholder priorities, not personal preference or political considerations
- Professional engineers should support implementation of decisions even when they disagree
- Documentation of decision rationale is essential for accountability and learning
- Project managers need both technical credibility and leadership courage

**Common Student Errors:**
- Choosing avoiding (problem won't resolve itself; timeline requires decision)
- Choosing compromising (hybrid filtration system may combine disadvantages of both approaches)
- Choosing accommodating (project manager must take responsibility, not delegate decision to one engineer)
- Failing to involve client in decision affecting risk and cost trade-offs

**Scenario 4: Documentation Format Dispute**

**Source of Conflict:**
Minor technical disagreement becoming personal dispute.

**Type of Conflict:**
Primarily interpersonal conflict masquerading as technical disagreement. Ego and control dynamics.

**Most Appropriate Strategy:**
**Avoiding** (or **Competing** with quick decision if avoidance proves insufficient)

**Justification:**
The issue is objectively trivial (either format acceptable, no project requirement). The conflict is disproportionate to issue importance. The engineers are junior, and this is a learning opportunity about professional behaviour. More senior team members recognise the conflict as petty. Avoiding (not intervening directly) signals that this is not worthy of management attention and allows engineers to save face by resolving it themselves or simply moving on. The project manager should monitor to ensure it doesn't escalate or affect work, but direct intervention would give the issue more importance than it deserves.

**If avoidance proves insufficient:** Make a quick decision ("use PDFs for final documentation, native format for working files"), communicate it briefly, and move on without extended discussion. This uses competing strategy but with minimal time investment.

**Specific Actions:**
1. Acknowledge receipt of both emails without taking sides
2. Respond: "Thank you both for your input. Either format is acceptable. Please coordinate between yourselves and let me know what you decide. I trust you'll reach a workable solution. The test report is due Friday—please focus your energy on completing that to the quality standard we discussed."
3. Monitor whether conflict escalates or affects work quality
4. If conflict continues beyond 2-3 days or becomes disruptive:
   - Make quick decision: "For consistency, all final documentation in PDF format, working files in whatever format is most efficient for the engineer"
   - Communicate briefly, move on
5. If conflict becomes personal or affects working relationships:
   - Brief individual conversations with each engineer about professional behaviour expectations
   - Clear message: technical debates welcome, personal conflicts unacceptable

**Potential Consequences:**

*Positive:*
- Engineers have opportunity to resolve conflict themselves (professional development)
- Project manager's time not wasted on trivial issue
- Signal sent that management attention goes to important issues
- Team sees project manager has appropriate priorities
- If engineers resolve it themselves, they learn conflict resolution skills

*Negative:*
- Conflict might escalate if personalities clash
- Engineers might interpret avoidance as lack of leadership
- Issue could fester and affect other aspects of their working relationship
- Other team members might become annoyed by continued bickering

**If Competing Strategy Used (Quick Decision):**

*Positive:*
- Issue resolved immediately
- Clear leadership demonstrated
- Engineers can move on to important work
- Minimal time invested

*Negative:*
- Missed opportunity for engineers to develop conflict resolution skills
- Project manager taking responsibility for trivial decisions

**Teaching Points:**
- Not every conflict requires management intervention
- Proportionality: management attention should match issue importance
- Junior staff sometimes need to learn through experience
- Avoiding is active choice, not passivity—requires monitoring
- Know when to let issues resolve naturally vs. when to intervene
- If intervention needed, don't invest extensive time in minor issues
- Sometimes people need to save face by resolving conflicts themselves
- Project managers must prioritise limited time on important issues

**Common Student Errors:**
- Choosing collaboration (far too much time investment for trivial issue)
- Choosing accommodating (creates precedent that any complaint gets management acquiescence)
- Over-analysing a minor issue
- Failing to recognise interpersonal dynamics beneath technical argument

## Additional Teaching Notes

### Timing Management

If workshop is running short (completed before 30 minutes):
- Extend closing discussion with more learner examples
- Have learners compare answers with a partner before whole-class discussion
- Add extension questions about cultural factors or virtual team considerations

If workshop is running long (over 30 minutes):
- Reduce number of scenarios in Activity 3 (select two rather than all four)
- Have learners complete Activity 1 for homework reflection
- Shorten closing discussion to 1-2 key points only

### Common Student Difficulties

**Difficulty distinguishing between conflict strategies:**
- Use simplified language: "compete = I win you lose, collaborate = we both win, compromise = we both win a bit, avoid = nobody wins yet, accommodate = you win I lose"
- Emphasise the assertiveness vs. cooperativeness dimensions
- Use physical space: have students stand at points in room representing different strategies

**Tendency to choose collaboration for everything:**
- Point out time and resource costs of collaboration
- Emphasise situational appropriateness
- Use scenarios where collaboration clearly inappropriate (safety issues, trivial matters)

**Difficulty applying Tuckman's model to scenarios:**
- Focus on key behavioural indicators: politeness (forming), conflict (storming), cooperation (norming), productivity (performing), endings (adjourning)
- Remind students teams can regress to earlier stages
- Use think-aloud modelling: demonstrate your reasoning process for identifying stages

**Overthinking trivial conflicts:**
- Explicitly teach proportionality: match effort to issue importance
- Use obvious examples: "Would you hold a 3-hour meeting to decide between blue or black binders?"
- Discuss opportunity cost: time spent on trivial issues is unavailable for important ones

### Links to Examination

Remind learners that exam questions may:
- Provide scenarios requiring identification of team development stages with recommended actions
- Ask for analysis of conflict situations with justified strategy selection
- Require evaluation of consequences of poor team building or conflict management
- Request recommendations for improving team effectiveness in specific contexts
- Test understanding of benefits and limitations of different approaches

Encourage learners to:
- Practice justifying answers with reference to theory (Tuckman, Thomas-Kilmann)
- Use engineering project examples in answers
- Consider multiple factors (issue importance, relationship importance, time, power)
- Write clear, structured responses showing analytical thinking

### Adaptations for Different Learner Needs

**For visual learners:**
- Create visual representations of conflict strategies (the 2x2 grid)
- Use colour coding for different team development stages
- Draw flowcharts for conflict resolution processes

**For kinaesthetic learners:**
- Consider role-play activities if time permits
- Have learners physically position themselves to represent conflict strategies
- Use gestures to represent different team stages

**For learners with English as additional language:**
- Provide glossary of key terms in advance
- Allow extra time for reading scenarios
- Permit use of dictionary
- Pair with confident English speaker for discussion

## Homework (Optional Extension)

For learners wishing to extend their understanding, suggest:

1. **Reflection Journal:** Over the next week, observe team interactions in any context (sports team, class group, work). Identify which stage of Tuckman's model the team is in and what behaviours led to this conclusion.

2. **Conflict Analysis:** Research a well-documented engineering project failure related to poor team dynamics or conflict management (e.g., Heathrow T5 baggage system, Sydney Opera House cost overruns). Write 300 words analysing what conflict management strategies might have improved outcomes.

3. **Self-Development Plan:** Based on self-assessment results, create a personal development plan identifying:
   - One team building skill to develop
   - One conflict management strategy to practice
   - Specific actions to take
   - How progress will be measured

4. **Case Study Research:** Find an example of successful team building or conflict management in an engineering project. Prepare a 5-minute presentation explaining what made it effective.

## Assessment for Learning

Consider using these formative assessment strategies:

**Exit Tickets:** As learners leave, ask them to write on a card:
- One thing they learned
- One question they still have
- One way they will apply today's learning

**Think-Pair-Share:** For any scenario, have learners:
1. Think individually (2 minutes)
2. Discuss with partner (3 minutes)
3. Share with whole class (2 minutes)

**Peer Assessment:** Learners exchange their Activity 3 responses and provide feedback:
- Is the strategy choice justified?
- Are the actions specific and practical?
- Are both positive and negative consequences considered?

**Self-Assessment:** Learners rate their confidence:
- "I can identify team development stages in scenarios" (1-5)
- "I can select appropriate conflict management strategies" (1-5)
- "I understand when to use each conflict strategy" (1-5)
