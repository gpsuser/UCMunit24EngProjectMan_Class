## Section B: Adapted Examination Questions

These questions are based on past examination questions but have been modified to provide additional practice with different scenarios.

- Historical delivery performance data showing 92% on-time delivery rate
- Customer testimonials describing the supplier as "very reliable"
- Price quotations showing unit costs of £45.50 per component

Complete the table below by identifying whether each piece of information is **qualitative** or **quantitative**, and whether it comes from an **internal** or **external** source.

```
+----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

|                                  | Quantitative)     | External)         |
+----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| 92% on-time delivery rate        |                   |                   |
+----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| "Very reliable" testimonials     |                   |                   |
+----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

### Question 4 (4 marks)
**Adapted from: January 2022 Paper, Question 3(c)**

A civil engineering project to construct a new bridge is using weather data to plan construction activities. The project team has access to:
- Historical rainfall data for the past 10 years showing average monthly precipitation
- Weather forecasts for the next 3 months predicting precipitation levels

Explain how **actual data** (historical rainfall) and **forecasted data** (weather predictions) each support the project planning process.

**Actual Data:**

```
________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________
```

**Forecasted Data:**

```
________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________
```

*[2 marks for explanation of how actual data supports planning]*  
*[2 marks for explanation of how forecasted data supports planning]*

## Section C: New Application Questions

These questions are entirely new and based on the Week 17 lecture content. They require you to apply your understanding to fresh scenarios.

### Question 5 (3 marks)

A project manager for an automotive manufacturing project needs to set quality targets for a new production line. 

Identify **three different internal sources of information** the project manager could use to establish appropriate quality targets, and for each source, briefly explain what information it would provide.

```
Internal Source 1: _______________________________________________________

Information provided: ____________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________


Internal Source 2: _______________________________________________________

Information provided: ____________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________


Internal Source 3: _______________________________________________________

Information provided: ____________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________
```

*[0.5 marks for each source identification = 1.5 marks]*  
*[0.5 marks for each explanation = 1.5 marks]*  
*[Total: 3 marks]*

### Question 6 (4 marks)

An aerospace engineering project is developing a new aircraft component. The project manager must decide whether to use an internal research and development facility or commission external consultants for technical analysis.

Compare the use of **internal sources** versus **external sources** for technical information by explaining:
- One **advantage** of using internal sources for this decision
- One **advantage** of using external sources for this decision

### Question 7 (4 marks)

A renewable energy project is planning the installation of wind turbines. The project manager needs information to support budget planning and must choose between different types of cost information.

The project manager has access to:
- **Actual costs** from three similar wind turbine projects completed in the past two years
