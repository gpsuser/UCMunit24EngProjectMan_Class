## SECTION B: Adapted Examination Questions (2 questions, 10 marks)

### Question 3 (5 marks)
**Adapted from**: June 2023 Question 4(b)(ii)

**Scenario Context**:
An aerospace engineering project has measured the improvement in manufacturing efficiency across four different production lines after implementing new quality control procedures. The percentage improvements are as follows:

- Assembly Line A: 8.5%
- Assembly Line B: 12.3%
- Assembly Line C: 6.7%
- Assembly Line D: 10.1%

**Task**:
Create a bar chart to display the percentage efficiency improvements for the four assembly lines. Your chart must include:

**(a)** Appropriate labels for both axes [1 mark]

**(b)** Correctly labelled bars for all four assembly lines [1 mark]

**(c)** Accurate bar heights representing the percentage improvements to one decimal place [3 marks - proportional marks available]

### Question 4 (5 marks)
**Adapted from**: January 2024 Question 3(b)

**Scenario Context**:
A civil engineering project is monitoring concrete strength during bridge construction. The project manager has collected compression test results (in MPa) over a seven-day curing period:

| Day | Compression Strength (MPa) |
|-----|---------------------------|
| 1 | 18.5 |
| 2 | 22.3 |
| 3 | 25.8 |
| 4 | 28.2 |
| 5 | 31.6 |
| 6 | 29.4 |
| 7 | 33.1 |

The industry standard for this type of concrete at seven days is 32.0 MPa.

**Task**:
**(a)** Calculate the mean compression strength over the seven-day period. Show your working. [2 marks]

Mean compression strength = ______________________ MPa


**(b)** Calculate the difference between the mean compression strength and the industry standard. [1 mark]

Difference = ______________________ MPa


**(c)** State whether the project has met, exceeded, or fallen below the industry standard. [1 mark]

Project performance: ______________________


**(d)** Explain what this result means for the project quality. [1 mark]

## SECTION C: New Questions Based on Lecture Content (3 questions, 19 marks)

### Question 5 (6 marks)
**Topic**: Organising Project Information

You are managing an automotive manufacturing project to develop a new electric vehicle battery system. You have received the following information from various sources:

- Supplier quotations for lithium-ion cells (external, quantitative)
- Customer satisfaction survey results from focus groups (external, qualitative)
- Production line capacity data (internal, quantitative)
- Engineering team's technical feasibility assessment (internal, qualitative)
- Market analysis report on competitor products (external, quantitative)
- Quality control test results from prototype batteries (internal, quantitative)
- Stakeholder feedback from the project steering committee (internal, qualitative)
- Government regulation requirements for battery safety (external, qualitative)

**Task**:
**(a)** Group the above information sources into the four categories shown in the table below. List at least one example for each category. [4 marks]

| | **Quantitative** | **Qualitative** |
|---|---|---|
| **Internal** | | |
| **External** | | |

**(b)** Explain why organising information into these categories is useful for project decision-making. [2 marks]

### Question 6 (7 marks)
**Topic**: Data Interpretation and Decision Making

A pharmaceutical manufacturing project has tracked the time taken (in minutes) to complete quality inspection procedures before and after implementing a new automated inspection system. The results are shown below:

**Before automation** (10 batches):
85, 92, 88, 95, 90, 87, 93, 89, 91, 86

**After automation** (10 batches):
62, 68, 65, 70, 64, 66, 69, 63, 67, 66

| Technical expertise (out of 10) | 40% | 9 | 7 | 8 |
| Cost competitiveness (out of 10) | 30% | 6 | 9 | 7 |

     Weighted Score = (Technical Ã— 0.4) + (Cost Ã— 0.3) + (Quality Ã— 0.2) + (Availability Ã— 0.1)
     
     Show your working for all three firms. [3 marks]

Firm A weighted score: ______________________

Firm B weighted score: ______________________

Firm C weighted score: ______________________
