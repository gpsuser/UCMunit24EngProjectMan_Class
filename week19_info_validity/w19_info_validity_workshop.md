## Instructions

This workshop contains seven questions designed to test your understanding of information validity criteria in engineering project management contexts. The questions are divided into three sections:

- **Section 1:** Past examination questions (Questions 1-2)
- **Section 2:** Adapted examination questions (Questions 3-4)
- **Section 3:** New application questions (Questions 5-7)

Read each question carefully and provide your answers in the spaces provided. Pay attention to the mark allocation as this indicates the depth of response required.

## Section 1: Past Examination Questions

### Question 1 (3 marks)
**Source: January 2024 Examination, Question 1(c)**

Match each validity criterion with its correct definition by drawing lines between them OR writing the letter of the definition next to each criterion.

**Validity Criteria:**

1. Quality
2. Reliability
3. Importance

**Definitions:**

A. Information coming from a trusted and reputable source  
B. Information that meets required standards and specifications  
C. Research that produces consistent results when repeated  
D. Information that is current and up-to-date  
E. Information that significantly affects project outcomes and decisions

**Your Answer:**

Criterion 1 (Quality) matches with definition: _______

Criterion 2 (Reliability) matches with definition: _______

Criterion 3 (Importance) matches with definition: _______

[1 mark for each correct match]

---

### Question 2 (3 marks)
**Source: January 2023 Examination, Question 2(c)**

Explain the difference between **complexity** and **degree of detail** when assessing information validity for an engineering project.

You must provide an example to illustrate the difference.

**Your Answer:**

```
Complexity:







Degree of detail:







Example:







```

[3 marks: 1 mark for explaining complexity, 1 mark for explaining degree of detail, 1 mark for appropriate example]

## Section 2: Adapted Examination Questions

### Question 3 (4 marks)

Match each validity criterion with its correct definition. Four criteria are provided below:

**Validity Criteria:**

1. Currency
2. Accuracy
3. Bias
4. Integrity of source

**Definitions:**

A. Whether information correctly represents the reality it describes  
B. Whether information originates from trustworthy and appropriately qualified sources  
C. Whether the source has interests or assumptions that may distort objectivity  
D. Whether information remains current and reflects the latest knowledge  
E. Whether information addresses matters significantly affecting project outcomes

**Your Answer:**

Criterion 1 (Currency) matches with definition: _______

Criterion 2 (Accuracy) matches with definition: _______

Criterion 3 (Bias) matches with definition: _______

Criterion 4 (Integrity of source) matches with definition: _______

[1 mark for each correct match]

### Question 4 (4 marks)

Explain the difference between **relevance** and **importance** when judging information validity in project management contexts.

Provide an engineering project example to illustrate when information might be relevant but not important, or important but not directly relevant.

**Your Answer:**

```
Relevance:







Importance:







Example:







```

[4 marks: 1 mark for explaining relevance, 1 mark for explaining importance, 2 marks for appropriate contextual example demonstrating the distinction]

## Section 3: New Application Questions

### Question 5 (6 marks)

An engineering project manager receives cost estimates for specialist CNC machining equipment from three sources:

**Source A:** Marketing brochure from the equipment manufacturer claiming "lowest total cost of ownership in the industry"

**Source B:** Independent testing laboratory report comparing five manufacturers' equipment over 12 months of operation

**Source C:** Informal conversation with a colleague who used similar equipment five years ago in a different industry

Assess the validity of **two** of these sources using **three** different validity criteria for each source.

**Your Answer:**

```
Source selected: _______

Validity Criterion 1: _______________________
Assessment:






Validity Criterion 2: _______________________
Assessment:






Validity Criterion 3: _______________________
Assessment:







Source selected: _______

Validity Criterion 1: _______________________
Assessment:






Validity Criterion 2: _______________________
Assessment:






Validity Criterion 3: _______________________
Assessment:






```

[6 marks: 1 mark for each appropriate validity criterion identified and correctly assessed]

### Question 6 (5 marks)

A project manager for a wind turbine installation project receives a detailed technical report on foundation design. The report contains extensive mathematical calculations, advanced geotechnical terminology, and references to multiple British Standards.

The project manager must share key findings with three audiences:
- The project sponsor (business background, no engineering training)
- The structural engineering team (specialist expertise)
- The construction contractors (practical site experience)

**(a)** Explain why the **complexity** of the original report might create validity issues when communicating with different audiences. (2 marks)

**(b)** Recommend how the project manager should address **degree of detail** differently for each audience to maintain information validity. (3 marks)

**Your Answer:**

```
(a) Complexity issues:











(b) Degree of detail recommendations:

For project sponsor:






For structural engineering team:






For construction contractors:






```

[5 marks total: 2 marks for part (a) explaining complexity-related validity issues; 3 marks for part (b) - 1 mark for each appropriate audience-specific recommendation]

### Question 7 (5 marks)

A pharmaceutical manufacturing project manager must select a supplier for sterile packaging materials. The project manager gathers information from multiple sources to support the decision.

For **each** of the following scenarios, identify **two validity criteria** that would be particularly critical to assess, and briefly justify why these criteria matter for this specific decision context.

**(a)** The supplier provides performance data showing 99.8% defect-free production. (2 marks)

**(b)** Industry forum posts from anonymous users discuss various suppliers' delivery reliability. (3 marks)

**Your Answer:**

```
(a) Performance data from supplier:

Critical Validity Criterion 1: _______________________
Justification:





Critical Validity Criterion 2: _______________________
Justification:






(b) Anonymous industry forum posts:

Critical Validity Criterion 1: _______________________
Justification:





Critical Validity Criterion 2: _______________________
Justification:





Critical Validity Criterion 3: _______________________
Justification:





```

[5 marks total: 1 mark for each appropriate criterion identified with valid justification in context]
