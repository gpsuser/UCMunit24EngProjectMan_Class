## Instructions for Learners

This workshop provides practice questions to consolidate your understanding of the three core project management tools (Gantt charts, Critical Path Analysis, and PERT) and how they can be integrated in real engineering projects.

The workshop is divided into three sections:
1. **Past Exam Questions** - Direct questions from previous examination papers
2. **Adapted Exam Questions** - Modified versions of actual exam questions
3. **New Integration Questions** - Original questions based on this week's lecture content

**Time Management Guidance:**
- Section 1: 0 minutes (no questions available)
- Section 2: 10 minutes (5 minutes per question)
- Section 3: 20 minutes (approximately 7 minutes per question)

**Assessment Criteria:**
All questions assess LO3 (Project Management Tools) with emphasis on:
- Understanding when to use each tool (LO3.1, LO3.2, LO3.3)
- Comparing advantages and disadvantages of different tools
- Applying appropriate tools to specific project scenarios
- Integrating multiple tools for comprehensive project management

## SECTION 1: Past Exam Questions (Verbatim from Examination Papers)

### Important Note for Learners

**Week 16 is a consolidation and integration workshop** that synthesises learning from Weeks 11-15 (Gantt Charts, Critical Path Analysis, and PERT). According to the examination alignment analysis, no questions in past examination papers are directly mapped to Week 16 because this week focuses on integrating previously learned tools rather than introducing new assessable content.

The examination alignment document states:

> "**Week 16**: Tools Integration Workshop - No direct assessment
> 
> **Note**: These weeks primarily serve as consolidation, assessment, and exam preparation periods rather than introducing new assessable content."

Therefore, **Section 1 contains no verbatim exam questions**. Instead, you will practice with adapted questions (Section 2) and new integration-focused questions (Section 3) that reflect the consolidation nature of this week's learning.

**What this means for your exam preparation:**
- Questions about individual tools (Gantt, CPA, PERT) appear frequently in exams (mapped to Weeks 11-15)
- Tool comparison and selection questions appear occasionally in various contexts
- Understanding when and how to integrate multiple tools demonstrates higher-level project management competency
- This workshop prepares you for scenario-based questions requiring tool selection judgement

## SECTION 2: Adapted Exam Questions (Based on Past Papers)

The following questions are **adapted versions** of actual examination questions, modified to focus on tool integration and comparison themes relevant to Week 16. The original source questions are referenced for your information.

---

### **Question 1** (6 marks)

**Adapted from:** June 2023, Question 3(a) and January 2023, Question 3(a)(i)-(ii)

**Scenario:**
Robinson Engineering Ltd is implementing a new quality management system across three manufacturing sites. The project manager, Alicia, is selecting appropriate project management tools for different stages of the project.

The project involves the following major activities:
- Gap analysis of current quality systems (3 weeks)
- Design new quality procedures (5 weeks, dependent on gap analysis)
- Staff training programme (4 weeks, can start during procedure design)
- System implementation at Site A (6 weeks, dependent on design completion)
- System implementation at Site B (6 weeks, dependent on design completion)
- System implementation at Site C (6 weeks, dependent on design completion)
- Final audit and certification (2 weeks, dependent on all implementations)

**(a)** Identify **three different project management tools** that Alicia could use during this project.
**(3 marks - 1 mark per tool identified)**

**(b)** For **one** of the tools you identified in part (a), explain **one advantage** of using this tool specifically for Robinson Engineering's quality management system project.
**(3 marks - 1 mark for tool selection, 2 marks for contextual advantage explanation)**

**Assumptions:**
- All activity durations are estimates
- Multiple sites can have systems implemented concurrently
- Training can happen while design is being finalised
- Final audit requires all implementations to be complete

**Helpful Hints:**
- Think about which tools help with activity sequencing
- Consider which tools help identify concurrent activities
- Remember which tools are best for communicating with different stakeholders
- Consider which tools help identify critical activities

---

### **Question 2** (8 marks)

**Adapted from:** January 2022, Question 2(c) and June 2024, Question 3(a)

**Scenario:**
Harwell Aerospace is developing a prototype electric aircraft motor. The project has high technical uncertainty because the technology is innovative and unproven. The project manager, Dev, needs to present the project plan to both the technical engineering team and the senior management board (who have limited technical expertise).

The project faces the following characteristics:
- **Uncertainty:** High - novel technology with unpredictable development challenges
- **Stakeholder diversity:** Technical engineers, non-technical executives, external investors
- **Project size:** Medium - approximately 45 distinct activities
- **Time criticality:** High - competitor companies are developing similar technology
- **Dependency complexity:** High - many interdependent research and development activities

**(a)** Recommend **which TWO project management tools** Dev should use for this project. Justify your recommendations by explaining how each tool addresses the specific project characteristics listed above.
**(6 marks - 1 mark per tool identified, 2 marks per justified explanation)**

**(b)** Explain **one limitation** that Dev should be aware of when using project management tools for this highly uncertain project.
**(2 marks - 1 mark for limitation identification, 1 mark for explanation)**

**Glossary:**
- **Prototype:** An early sample or model built to test a concept
- **Stakeholder diversity:** The range of different types of people involved in or affected by the project
- **Dependency complexity:** How interconnected and reliant on each other different project activities are

**Helpful Hints:**
- Consider which tool is best for handling uncertainty in activity durations
- Think about which tool provides the clearest visual communication for non-technical audiences
- Remember which tool helps identify which activities must be completed on time to avoid project delays
- The question asks for TWO tools - explain how they complement each other

### **Question 3** (10 marks)

**Scenario:**
Midlands Water Authority is planning a major infrastructure project to replace aging water mains across a city district. The project manager, Sofia, is determining which project management tools to use during different project phases.

**Project Characteristics:**
- **Project size:** Large - over 200 distinct activities
- **Duration:** 18 months
- **Uncertainty:** Low - similar projects completed successfully in the past
- **Stakeholders:** City council (politicians), residents, contractors, environmental regulators
- **Primary constraint:** Must minimize disruption to traffic and residents
- **Dependencies:** Complex street-by-street sequencing required

**Sofia's Tool Selection Decision Framework (from Week 16 Lecture):**

```
Step 1: Characterise the Project
- Size: Large (>100 activities)
- Dependencies: Complex
- Uncertainty: Low
- Stakeholders: Diverse (technical and non-technical)
- Time criticality: Moderate

Step 2: Identify Mandatory Requirements
- Visual communication to non-technical stakeholders? [YES/NO]
- Identify critical activities precisely? [YES/NO]
- Account for significant schedule uncertainty? [YES/NO]
- Support resource levelling? [YES/NO]

Step 3: Select Tool Combination
Based on mandatory requirements above...
```

**(a)** Complete Step 2 of Sofia's decision framework by determining whether each mandatory requirement applies to this project. For each requirement, write **YES** or **NO** and provide a **brief justification** (one sentence).
**(4 marks - 1 mark per correct determination with justification)**

**(b)** Based on your answers to part (a), recommend **which combination of project management tools** Sofia should use for this infrastructure project. Explain **two reasons** why your recommended combination is appropriate for this specific project.
**(6 marks - 2 marks for tool combination identification, 4 marks for two justified reasons)**

**Helpful Hints:**
- Refer to the tool comparison table from this week's lecture
- Consider that Sofia must report to city councillors who are not engineers
- Think about the large number of activities and complex sequencing requirements
- Remember that the project has low uncertainty due to previous experience
- Multiple tools can be used together - integration is often best practice

### **Question 4** (12 marks) - **Extended Response Question**

**Scenario:**
TechForward Ltd, a robotics manufacturer, is developing an automated warehouse system for a major retail client. The project manager, James, must select appropriate project management tools.

**Project Context:**
- **Client requirement:** System must be operational before the peak retail season (hard deadline in 8 months)
- **Technical challenge:** Integrating new AI software with existing warehouse infrastructure
- **Team composition:** Mix of experienced engineers and newly hired graduates
- **Budget:** Fixed price contract - no contingency for cost overruns
- **Uncertainty:** Medium - the AI software is proven but hasn't been integrated with this client's specific systems before

James is considering using **all three project management tools** (Gantt charts, Critical Path Analysis, and PERT) in combination throughout the project lifecycle.

**Using the case study examples from Week 16 lecture (Heathrow Terminal 5 and Crossrail), evaluate whether James should use all three tools in combination for this project.**

Your answer should:
- **Identify** which project management tools James should use
- **Explain** the purpose and timing of each tool within the project lifecycle
- **Analyse** the advantages and disadvantages of using multiple tools together for this specific project
- **Evaluate** whether the benefits of using all three tools outweigh the time and resources required to implement them
- **Provide** a justified overall recommendation

**(12 marks - assessed using levels of response marking)**

**Mark Scheme Levels:**
- **Level 1 (1-3 marks):** Identifies tools with basic description
- **Level 2 (4-6 marks):** Explains purposes of tools with some project context
- **Level 3 (7-9 marks):** Analyses advantages and disadvantages of tool integration with clear project application
- **Level 4 (10-12 marks):** Evaluates tool combination with justified recommendation, demonstrating understanding of professional practice and resource constraints

**Glossary:**
- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Computer systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence
- **Hard deadline:** A fixed date that cannot be moved
- **Fixed price contract:** Agreement where the price is set and cannot be increased
- **Integration:** Combining different systems or components to work together

**Helpful Hints:**
- Reference the Heathrow Terminal 5 case study - they used PERT initially, then CPA + Gantt during construction
- Reference the Crossrail case study - comprehensive planning tools didn't prevent delays (quality of inputs matters)
- Consider the 8-month timeline - is there enough time for sophisticated planning?
- Think about the team composition - newly hired graduates may need simpler tools
- Remember the fixed price contract - what's the cost of creating and maintaining multiple tools?
- Medium uncertainty - does this justify PERT, or are simpler estimates adequate?

### **Question 5** (6 marks)

**Scenario:**
Three different engineering project managers are discussing their tool selection approaches at a professional networking event:

**Project Manager A (Sanjay):** "I always use Gantt charts for every project regardless of size or complexity. They're visual, easy to understand, and that's what our company software supports best."

**Project Manager B (Emma):** "I assess each project individually using a decision framework. For my current 15-activity office refurbishment project with a tight deadline, I'm using both Gantt charts and Critical Path Analysis even though it's small."

**Project Manager C (Marcus):** "For my aerospace R&D project with 30 activities and high uncertainty, I'm only using PERT. I don't see the point of Gantt charts when you have three-point estimates that account for risk."

**(a)** Using the tool selection criteria from Week 16 lecture, evaluate **Project Manager B's (Emma's) approach**. Explain whether her decision to use both Gantt charts and CPA for a small 15-activity project is justified.
**(3 marks - 1 mark for judgement, 2 marks for justified explanation)**

**(b)** Identify **one potential problem** with **Project Manager C's (Marcus's) approach** of using only PERT for his aerospace R&D project. Explain why integrating PERT with another tool might be beneficial.
**(3 marks - 1 mark for problem identification, 2 marks for explanation of integration benefit)**

**Helpful Hints:**
- Remember the Week 16 lecture principle: "No Single 'Best' Tool" - each serves distinct purposes
- Consider Emma's tight deadline - does this justify the extra effort of CPA for a small project?
- Think about what PERT provides (risk-adjusted estimates) versus what it doesn't provide (visual timeline, progress monitoring)
- The lecture stated: "Integration is Standard Practice" - why is this the case?
